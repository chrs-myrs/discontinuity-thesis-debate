  - Coordination will fail: **90%**
  - UBI won't solve: **80%**
- **Key Evidence**: 41% hiring freezes, 100x productivity gains documented
- **Evolution**: Strengthened position based on Myers's empirical data

## Convergence/Divergence Analysis

### Areas of Agreement (Emerging)
- AI disruption in software is real (All experts)
- Some level of economic impact inevitable (All experts)
- Timeline uncertain but change accelerating (Most experts)

### Key Disagreements
1. **Speed**: 2 years (Myers) vs 50 years (Vasquez)
2. **Completeness**: Total automation (Chen) vs Persistent human roles (Patel)
3. **Agency**: Deterministic (Chen) vs Shapeable (Martinez, Thompson)
4. **Precedent**: Unprecedented (Chen, Myers) vs Historical pattern (Vasquez)

### Confidence Trends
- **Rising**: Chen (evidence supports inevitability)
- **Stable**: Myers (consistent with experience)
- **Unknown**: Others pending evidence review
