# Current Expert Panel Positions

## Position Summary as of: [Current Date]

### Dr. Marcus "Inevitability" Chen (Discontinuity Advocate)
**Core Position**: *"We're past hypotheticals - discontinuity is mechanically inevitable"*
- **Confidence Level**: 85-90% that discontinuity is already underway
- **Key Evidence**: Unit cost dominance observable now (copywriting $50â†’$0.02, code generation 40%+ automated)
- **Main Argument**: Coordination impossible with billions of potential defectors
- **Predictions**: Mass employment obsolescence within 5-10 years
- **Would Change Mind If**: AI plateaus 5+ years, successful international coordination mechanism demonstrated

### Dr. Sarah "Resilience" Martinez (Adaptation Economist)  
**Core Position**: *"Institutions can adapt through coordination and alternative models"*
- **Confidence Level**: 70-80% that adaptation mechanisms will succeed
- **Key Evidence**: UBI trials showing increased participation, Nordic model success, professional licensing coordination
- **Main Argument**: Markets are constructed institutions we can modify
- **Predictions**: Hybrid human-AI economy with quality premiums and regulation
- **Would Change Mind If**: Multiple coordination attempts fail, alternative models prove non-scalable

### Dr. Raj "Limits" Patel (Technology Realist)
**Core Position**: *"AI adoption more limited and expensive than claimed"*
- **Confidence Level**: 75-85% that AI limitations prevent full displacement
- **Key Evidence**: Verification costs growing, hallucination rates 15-30%, deployment failures
- **Main Argument**: Human-AI collaboration outperforms pure automation
- **Predictions**: AI augmentation rather than replacement in most domains
- **Would Change Mind If**: Major AI breakthrough enables reliable AGI, verification costs decline

### Dr. Elena "Precedent" Vasquez (Historical Comparativist)
**Core Position**: *"Current disruption follows familiar adaptation patterns"*
- **Confidence Level**: 80-85% that historical precedents apply
- **Key Evidence**: Industrial Revolution fears proved wrong, computing created more jobs, coordination successes
- **Main Argument**: Adaptation mechanisms have accelerated, not failed
- **Predictions**: New job categories emerging, institutional innovation during transition
- **Would Change Mind If**: Evidence cognitive automation truly unprecedented, adaptation capacity proven limited

### Dr. James "Solutions" Thompson (Coordination Theorist)
**Core Position**: *"Coordination solvable through proper mechanism design"*
- **Confidence Level**: 70-80% that coordination mechanisms can be designed successfully
- **Key Evidence**: Professional licensing, Basel Accords, Montreal Protocol success
- **Main Argument**: Right incentive structures can align individual and collective interests
- **Predictions**: Regulatory frameworks creating human-oversight requirements
- **Would Change Mind If**: Well-designed coordination attempts fail, competitive pressure proves truly irresistible

## Key Areas of Disagreement

### 1. Speed and Scale of AI Impact
- **Chen**: Already happening at scale, mechanical inevitability
- **Patel**: Limited by technical constraints and hidden costs
- **Others**: Significant but manageable with proper institutions

### 2. Coordination Feasibility
- **Chen**: Impossible with billions of potential defectors
- **Martinez/Thompson**: Professional licensing proves it works
- **Vasquez**: Historical precedents show coordination success

### 3. Alternative Economic Models
- **Chen**: UBI creates dependency, doesn't restore agency
- **Martinez**: Nordic models and cooperatives prove viability
- **Thompson**: Mechanism design can create sustainable alternatives

### 4. Historical Precedent Relevance
- **Chen**: Cognitive automation categorically different
- **Vasquez**: Consistent patterns across all technological revolutions
- **Patel**: Technical limitations make comparisons relevant

## Evolution Tracking

### Position Changes Since Initial Statements:
- [Track any expert position modifications based on evidence]
- [Note confidence level adjustments]
- [Record new evidence acknowledgments]

### Research Impact:
- [How commissioned research has affected expert positions]
- [Which evidence has been most persuasive]
- [Outstanding research needs identified]

### Convergence Areas:
- All experts acknowledge AI will create significant change
- Agreement that some coordination mechanisms will be necessary
- Recognition that transition period will involve challenges

### Persistent Disagreements:
- Scale and speed of displacement
- Feasibility of coordination at required scale  
- Viability of alternative economic models
- Relevance of historical precedents

**Next Steps**: Areas requiring additional research or analysis to resolve key disagreements.
