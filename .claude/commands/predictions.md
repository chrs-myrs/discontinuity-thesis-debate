# Expert Panel Prediction Tracking

## Prediction Accountability Framework

### Time Horizons:
- **Short-term**: 1-2 years (testable quickly)
- **Medium-term**: 3-5 years (key transition period)  
- **Long-term**: 5-10 years (ultimate outcomes)

### Confidence Calibration:
- **90-95%**: Very high confidence, reputation at stake
- **70-85%**: High confidence, core thesis predictions
- **50-70%**: Moderate confidence, uncertain factors
- **30-50%**: Low confidence, speculative
