# Chris Myers - Position Clarification
## The AI-Native Business Disruption Model

### Core Mechanism (Corrected)

**NOT**: Existing companies gradually automating their workforce

**BUT RATHER**: Brand new AI-native businesses with zero or one human (the founder/owner) completely displacing traditional companies

### Key Distinctions

1. **One-Person Unicorns**
   - Single individual + AI stack = entire company
   - No employees, no HR, no management layers
   - Pure AI automation from day one
   - Can compete with traditional corporations

2. **Bot-Owned Businesses**
   - Eventually, even the human founder becomes optional
   - Autonomous AI entities running businesses
   - No human overhead whatsoever
   - Ultimate cost advantage

3. **Disruption Pattern**
   - Not gradual automation within companies
   - Complete replacement by new entities
   - Traditional businesses can't compete with zero-human-cost structure
   - Mass unemployment through business displacement, not internal automation

4. **Why Existing Companies Can't Adapt**
   - Legacy structures and obligations
   - Can't fire everyone overnight
   - Cultural and organizational inertia
   - AI-native competitors have no such constraints

5. **Speed of Disruption**
   - AI-native businesses can launch in days
   - Instant global reach
   - No hiring, training, management overhead
   - Exponential advantage over traditional structures

### Examples Already Emerging

- Solo developers with AI replacing entire dev shops
- One-person AI content agencies outcompeting traditional agencies
- Individual + AI competing with consulting firms
- Bot-driven trading firms with no human traders

### The Real Discontinuity

The discontinuity isn't companies automating workers away - it's entire industries being replaced by AI-native entities that never had workers to begin with.

This is why coordination fails: you can't coordinate with entities that don't exist yet and have no reason to play by old rules.

### Chris's Questions for Ben
*[To be provided by Chris based on this corrected understanding]*

### Implications for the Debate

This mechanism is actually MORE disruptive than gradual automation because:
1. No transition period
2. No adaptation time for workers
3. Complete business model disruption
4. Traditional competitive advantages meaningless
5. Regulatory frameworks can't keep pace

The expert panel needs to address not just automation within companies, but complete replacement BY AI-native entities.
