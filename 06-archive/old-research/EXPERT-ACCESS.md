# Expert Panel Research Access Guide

## For All Expert Agents

This folder contains **19 comprehensive research reports** plus supporting documentation that should inform your positions and arguments in the Discontinuity Thesis debate.

### How to Use These Reports

1. **Reference Specific Reports** - When making claims, cite: "According to Research Report 6, 41% of software companies have implemented hiring freezes..."

2. **Acknowledge Contradictions** - When reports conflict with your position, address them: "While Report 3 shows UBI increases work participation, this may not scale..."

3. **Build on Evidence** - Layer empirical findings with theoretical arguments: "Report 9 demonstrates individual AI capabilities, supporting my position that..."

4. **Identify Gaps** - Note what's missing: "Reports lack data on [specific area], requiring further investigation..."

5. **Update Positions** - Evolve views based on evidence: "Report 7's finding of 3-5x rather than exponential acceleration requires adjusting my timeline..."

### Key Statistics for Quick Reference

- **41%** of software companies have hiring freezes (Report 6)
- **70%** of code being AI-generated in some companies (Report 6)
- **3-5x** acceleration from recursive AI, not exponential (Report 7)
- **85-95%** compliance achievable through coordination (Report 1)
- **4.2x** higher real AI deployment costs than estimated (Report 2)
- **11%** increase in work participation with UBI (Report 3)
- **67%** of AI projects fail to meet objectives (Report 2)
- **18-36 months** for industry disruption when barriers collapse (Report 8)
- **$2,000** hardware enables individual to match small companies (Report 9)
- **57%** of cognitive work has structural resistance to automation (Report 10)

### Research Credibility Levels

**Highest Confidence** (Empirical data, multiple sources)
- Reports 12, 13, 14 (external empirical studies)
- Report 6 (current industry data)
- Report 3 (UBI experimental evidence)

**High Confidence** (Strong analysis, some empirical support)
- Reports 1, 2, 7, 9, 10 (detailed analysis with evidence)
- Reports 15, 18 (technical analysis)

**Moderate Confidence** (Projections based on current trends)
- Reports 4, 5, 8 (trajectory and timeline projections)
- Reports 16, 17, 19 (social and alternative models)

**Theoretical** (Informed speculation)
- Report 11 (future governance frameworks)
- Extreme scenarios in all reports

### Critical Debates These Reports Inform

1. **Timeline Debate** - Reports 5, 6, 8 provide evidence on speed
2. **Capability Debate** - Reports 4, 7, 15 analyze AI limitations
3. **Economic Impact** - Reports 2, 3, 18, 19 examine economics
4. **Adaptation Possibility** - Reports 1, 14, 16, 19 explore responses
5. **Individual vs Institutional** - Report 9 analyzes power shift
6. **Human Relevance** - Reports 10, 13, 17 examine human roles

### Remember

You are engaged in truth-seeking, not position defense. Use these reports to:
- Refine and evolve your positions
- Acknowledge uncertainty where it exists
- Make testable predictions
- Propose solutions, not just problems
- Find synthesis where possible

The goal is not to win the debate but to approximate truth about AI's impact on humanity's future.
