## External Research Report

### Source
Original research conducted externally and provided as PDF: "Humanâ€“AI Collaboration Effectiveness: Myth vs. Reality.pdf"

### Executive Summary
This report examines the actual effectiveness of human-AI collaboration models, comparing theoretical promises with empirical outcomes across various domains and use cases.

### Key Findings
- Human-AI teams often outperform either alone
- Significant variation in collaboration effectiveness by domain
- Trust and training critical success factors
- Many collaboration failures due to poor design
- Complementarity more important than capability

### Relevance to Debate
Critical evidence for evaluating whether AI will replace or augment human workers. Particularly relevant to:
- Patel's position on hybrid models
- Myers's experience with AI augmentation
- Martinez's adaptation arguments
- Quality and verification discussions

### Status
Full report available as PDF in /research/outputs/

### Integration Notes
Provides empirical grounding for collaboration vs. replacement debate, challenging pure automation scenarios.
