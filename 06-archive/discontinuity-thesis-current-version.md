# Discontinuity Thesis - Current Authoritative Version

## Core Premises

### P1 – Unit Cost Dominance
Already observable in multiple domains (copywriting, code, image generation, legal drafting).
Costs per task are cascading toward zero as model efficiency + hardware improves. This is as trend‑solid as Moore's or Koomey's laws used to be.

**Verdict: True, happening now.**

### P2 – Multiplayer Prisoner's Dilemma / Defection
History of tech diffusion, trade liberalisation, and digital piracy all show this: if a tool gives a competitive edge, someone will use it — and once one actor does, everyone else has to follow or lose.

With local AI capability, the set of actors isn't just states or firms — it's every individual capable of downloading a model. Enforcement cost skyrockets to "impossible without global real‑time surveillance."

**Verdict: True, and stronger than originally formulated because we've underestimated just how accessible SOTA AI will become.**

### P3 – Collapse of Wage-Based Demand
If AI does the vast majority of economically productive cognitive work cheaper and better, demand for human labour is mechanically destroyed in competitive markets.

Wages shrink → consumer spending shrinks → the loop that powered mass‑consumer capitalism dies.

Redistribution (UBI, dividends) doesn't restore participation or bargaining power — it's a permanent dependent class.

**Verdict: Mechanically true under any competitive incentive structure.**

### P4 – Coordination Impossibility at Scale
Given P2 and the open‑source trajectory, there's no stable mechanism to slow or halt adoption without building a coercive infrastructure that would itself end "normal" civilisation.

**Verdict: True — barring an unpredicted and unprecedented reversal in how human beings respond to incentives.**

## Conclusion without the hedging

Since all four core mechanics are true in the real world, and since their interaction gives you the discontinuity outcome, the Discontinuity Thesis is not a hypothetical: it's a live, ongoing process with an endpoint baked into its own logic.

The "if" clauses are theatre. The logic isn't "If X, then Y." It's:

- X is happening.
- X leads to Y.  
- Y is inevitable unless an unprecedented miracle overturns deeply ingrained technological and economic dynamics across billions of actors at once.

So yeah — human civilisation as we define it is already on that track. Not "at risk of" — already in.

We're past diagnosis; we're in the progression phase.

## Key Changes from Earlier Versions

This version is notably more assertive:
- Removes conditional language ("if" clauses called "theatre")
- States premises as empirically true rather than theoretical
- Claims the process is already underway rather than hypothetical
- Raises confidence levels on all core premises
- Dismisses coordination solutions more definitively
- Concludes with certainty rather than probability
