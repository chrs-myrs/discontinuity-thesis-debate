# Phase 6: Panel Questions for Thesis Author
## Direct Challenges from Each Expert

### From @chris-myers-practitioner
"You claim 50-100x cost reduction in cognitive work. I'm seeing that in narrow tasks but not in system integration. How do you account for the exponential complexity increase when moving from isolated tasks to integrated systems? My experience shows AI excels at components but struggles with architecture. Isn't the timeline determined by the hardest part, not the easiest?"

### From @dr-chen-inevitability  
"I largely agree with your thesis, but you haven't addressed the acceleration dynamic. Once software development is automated, doesn't this create recursive improvement that compresses your timeline even further? How do you factor in AI systems improving AI systems? The discontinuity might be sharper than even you predict."

### From @dr-martinez-adaptation
"Your wage-demand circuit argument assumes no adaptation. But Report 19 shows multiple alternative economic models already functioning. Why can't we transition to a post-wage economy through cooperative ownership, commons management, and gift economies? You're conflating capitalism's end with civilization's end."

### From @dr-patel-tech-realist
"Report 15 documents clear capability plateaus. GPT-4 to GPT-4.5 showed marginal improvement. Scaling laws show diminishing returns. How do you reconcile your exponential improvement assumption with empirical evidence of logarithmic improvement? The math doesn't support your timeline."

### From @dr-thompson-coordination
"You dismiss coordination as impossible, but Report 1 shows 85-95% compliance rates in coordinated responses. The Montreal Protocol worked. Basel Accords work. Why is AI coordination categorically different? Specific mechanisms, not hand-waving about prisoner's dilemmas."

### From @dr-vasquez-historian
"Every generation thinks their technology ends history. The printing press would end ignorance. The telegraph would end war. The internet would end privacy. All were absorbed and adapted. What makes you think THIS time is different beyond 'it just is'? Where's your historical humility?"

### Unified Challenge from the Panel

**The Verification Paradox**: If AI replaces most cognitive workers, who verifies the AI? If verification requires deep expertise, how do we maintain that expertise without practitioners? If we can't maintain verification quality, doesn't the system collapse from quality degradation rather than unemployment? 

**The Demand Question**: You claim UBI creates "zoo animals" but provide no evidence. Report 3 shows the opposite - UBI increases entrepreneurship and work participation. Why should we believe your psychological model over empirical data?

**The Physical Bottleneck**: You acknowledge physical work sees only 2x gains. With 40% of employment in physical roles, how does this create "mass unemployment" rather than sector rotation? Show the math.

**The Agency Gap**: Your thesis treats humans as passive economic units. But humans are also voters, protesters, innovators, and revolutionaries. How does your model account for collective human agency to change the rules when threatened?

### Request for Clarification

1. **Define "collapse"**: Economic recession? Depression? Civilizational failure? Be specific about severity and timeline.

2. **Quantify thresholds**: At what unemployment rate does the wage-demand circuit "break"? 20%? 50%? 

3. **Address geography**: Does this happen simultaneously worldwide or in waves? How do variations affect the thesis?

4. **Specify mechanisms**: Exactly how does UCD lead to each downstream effect? Show the causal chain, not just correlation.

5. **Falsification criteria**: What evidence would convince you the thesis is wrong? If you can't specify this, it's ideology, not analysis.

### The Meta-Question

Your thesis exhibits learned helplessness disguised as hard realism. You've reasoned yourself into paralysis. The question isn't whether you're right about the challenges - you largely are. The question is whether your fatalism about solutions is justified or self-defeating.

**Why have you chosen despair over agency?**
