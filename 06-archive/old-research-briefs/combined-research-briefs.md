## Research Brief 4: AI Capability Trajectory and Plateaus
*[Partially covered by "AI Capability Limitations and Plateau Evidence.pdf" but needs Myers update]*

### Research Question
**Will AI capabilities continue exponential improvement toward AGI, or are we hitting fundamental technical plateaus that limit displacement potential?**

1. Are training costs growing faster than capability improvements (GPT-3 → GPT-4 → GPT-5)?
2. What are current AI reliability/hallucination rates in professional applications?
3. Are we seeing diminishing returns to scale in large language models?
4. What fundamental technical barriers might prevent full cognitive automation?
5. How do human-AI teams perform vs. pure AI systems in complex tasks?

### Myers-Specific Addition
- Are hallucinations "essentially eliminated" in latest models as Myers claims?

- What's the trajectory for local vs. cloud model capabilities?

### Data Points Needed
- Training cost vs. performance improvement curves
- Benchmark progression rates (slowing or accelerating?)
- Hallucination/error rates in professional domains

2. What's the fastest industry-wide transformation on record?
3. How quickly can institutions adapt in crisis conditions?
4. Are there precedents for individual actors disrupting entire industries?
5. What happened when barriers to entry approached zero historically?

### Data Points Needed
- Fastest adoption curves in history (electricity, internet, smartphones)
- Shortest time from innovation to 50% market penetration
- Crisis response speeds (wartime mobilization, pandemic response)
- Individual vs. corporate disruption patterns
- Zero barrier to entry historical examples

### Key Sub-Questions to Investigate
1. Current adoption rates of AI coding tools (Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor)
2. Actual productivity metrics from companies using AI-assisted development
3. Developer hiring trends Q3-Q4 2024 - hiring freezes spreading?
4. Quality metrics - bug rates, security issues in AI-generated code
5. One-person software companies - documented cases?

### Data Points Needed
- GitHub Copilot usage statistics and productivity data
- Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 on AI adoption

## Synthesis Questions for All Research

### For External AI Systems (GPT-5, Claude, Perplexity)
"Based on all evidence, what is the probability distribution for:
1. Myers's 2-year software automation timeline being accurate
2. Mass unemployment (>20%) within 5 years (Myers timeline)
3. Individual actors outcompeting all corporations
4. Recursive AI improvement creating singularity conditions
5. Emergency interventions successfully slowing automation

Provide confidence intervals and key determining factors."

### Critical Evidence Gaps to Fill
"What evidence would definitively prove or disprove:
- Myers's 100x productivity claim
- The recursive improvement loop
- 2-year automation timeline
- Individual vs. institutional power shift
- Possibility of emergency coordination"

## Priority Order for Research

### URGENT (Need within days)
1. **Software Industry Reality Check** - Is Myers an outlier or leading indicator?
2. **Recursive AI Development** - Is the loop real and accelerating?

### HIGH PRIORITY (Need within week)
3. **AI Capability Trajectory** - Are we plateauing or accelerating?
4. **Economic Disruption Speed** - Can change happen in 2 years?

### IMPORTANT (Need for synthesis)
5. **Historical Precedent** - Any 100x/2-year precedents?
6. **Individual vs. Institutional** - Can one person = corporation?
7. **Automation Resistance** - What can't be automated?

This research will determine whether we face a 2-year emergency (Myers) or 10-year transition (other experts).
