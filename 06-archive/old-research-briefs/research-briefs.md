## Research Brief 1: Coordination Effectiveness Analysis

### Research Question
**Can human institutions effectively coordinate AI deployment at the scale required to prevent economic displacement?**

### Key Sub-Questions to Investigate
1. What are the empirical success rates of professional licensing systems globally (medical, legal, engineering)?
2. Why did Basel Accords succeed (88% compliance) while climate agreements fail (23% compliance)?
3. What is the current compliance rate with early AI regulations (EU AI Act, China's regulations)?
4. How effective are enforcement mechanisms at preventing defection in domains with strong competitive pressure?
5. Can coordination mechanisms scale to handle billions of potential individual actors with access to open-source AI?

### Data Points Needed
- Professional licensing compliance rates across countries
- Basel Accords implementation metrics and prevented costs
- Open-source AI download statistics vs. regulated deployment in professional domains
- Enforcement costs vs. benefits (ROI analysis)
- Factors that correlate with coordination success vs. failure

### Position to Test
- **Dr. Chen**: Claims coordination impossible with billions of defectors
- **Dr. Martinez/Thompson**: Claim professional licensing proves coordination works
- **Critical Test**: Whether existing coordination mechanisms can scale to AI governance

### Request for GPT-5/Other Tools
"Analyze historical coordination successes and failures to determine whether AI governance can achieve the 70%+ compliance rates seen in professional licensing and financial regulation, or if it's doomed to <30% compliance like climate agreements. Focus on incentive structures, enforcement mechanisms, and scalability."

## Research Brief 2: True Cost of AI Deployment

### Research Question
**When all costs are considered (infrastructure, verification, liability, maintenance), does AI actually provide the claimed 10-100x cost advantages, or do hidden costs eliminate the economic incentive for mass automation?**

### Key Sub-Questions to Investigate
1. What are the hidden costs in AI deployment (verification, monitoring, compliance, insurance)?
2. How fast are verification engineer salaries growing vs. AI inference cost reductions?
3. What are enterprise AI project failure rates and associated write-off costs?
4. How do professional liability insurance costs change with AI adoption?
5. Does human-AI collaboration or pure automation provide better ROI?

### Data Points Needed
- Total Cost of Ownership breakdown for AI systems
- Verification engineer salary trends 2020-2024
- Enterprise AI success/failure rates by industry
- Insurance premium changes for AI-assisted services
- Comparative ROI: human-only vs. human-AI vs. pure AI

### Position to Test
- **Dr. Chen**: Claims unit cost dominance makes AI adoption inevitable
- **Dr. Patel**: Claims hidden costs often exceed savings
- **Critical Test**: Whether TCO of AI is actually lower than human labor

### Request for GPT-5/Other Tools
"Analyze real-world AI deployment costs including all hidden expenses (verification, compliance, liability, maintenance) to determine if the claimed 10-100x cost advantages actually materialize, or if total costs often exceed human labor costs. Include enterprise failure rates and insurance impacts."

## Research Brief 3: UBI and Economic Participation

### Research Question
**Do Universal Basic Income programs increase or decrease economic participation, and can alternative economic models (cooperatives, Nordic systems) maintain human agency under technological pressure?**

### Key Sub-Questions to Investigate
1. What is the employment impact of long-term UBI programs (Alaska PFD, Kenya, Finland)?
2. Do UBI recipients show higher or lower rates of entrepreneurship and education?
3. How do cooperatives like Mondragón perform under technological/competitive pressure?
4. Can Nordic models (50%+ redistribution) maintain productivity with increasing automation?
5. What determines whether redistribution creates dependency vs. empowerment?

### Data Points Needed
- Employment rates for UBI recipients vs. control groups
- Entrepreneurship and education enrollment changes
- Mondragón financial performance and employment trends
- Nordic countries' productivity vs. redistribution levels
- Psychological/social factors in economic participation

### Position to Test
- **Dr. Chen**: Claims UBI creates permanent dependency
- **Dr. Martinez**: Claims UBI increases participation (Alaska evidence)
- **Critical Test**: Long-term employment effects of redistribution

### Request for GPT-5/Other Tools
"Analyze empirical evidence from UBI trials worldwide, particularly long-term programs like Alaska's PFD, to determine whether income guarantees increase or decrease work participation, entrepreneurship, and economic agency. Include analysis of cooperative models and Nordic systems under technological pressure."

## Research Brief 4: AI Capability Trajectory and Plateaus

### Research Question
**Will AI capabilities continue exponential improvement toward AGI, or are we hitting fundamental technical plateaus that limit displacement potential?**

### Key Sub-Questions to Investigate
1. Are training costs growing faster than capability improvements (GPT-3 → GPT-4 → GPT-5)?
2. What are current AI reliability/hallucination rates in professional applications?
3. Are we seeing diminishing returns to scale in large language models?
4. What fundamental technical barriers might prevent full cognitive automation?
5. How do human-AI teams perform vs. pure AI systems in complex tasks?

### Data Points Needed
- Training cost vs. performance improvement curves
- Benchmark progression rates (slowing or accelerating?)
- Hallucination/error rates in professional domains
- Data availability constraints and quality issues
- Human-AI collaboration effectiveness metrics

### Position to Test
- **Dr. Chen**: Claims exponential improvement will continue
- **Dr. Patel**: Claims plateaus and diminishing returns evident
- **Critical Test**: Whether current limitations are temporary or fundamental

### Request for GPT-5/Other Tools
"Analyze technical trends in AI development to determine if we're approaching fundamental limits (architectural, data, verification) or if exponential capability growth will continue. Include analysis of training costs, benchmark progressions, and reliability constraints in professional applications."

## Research Brief 5: Historical Precedent Analysis

### Research Question
**Is AI-driven cognitive automation truly unprecedented, or does it follow patterns seen in previous technological revolutions that seemed equally threatening to contemporaries?**

### Key Sub-Questions to Investigate
1. How accurate were predictions of mass unemployment from previous technological revolutions?
2. How quickly did new job categories emerge during past transitions?
3. What was the actual timeline of institutional adaptation in previous revolutions?
4. How does current AI adoption speed compare to electricity, computers, internet?
5. What patterns consistently appear across technological transitions?

### Data Points Needed
- Historical unemployment predictions vs. actual outcomes
- Job creation/destruction ratios from past revolutions
- Institutional adaptation timelines (labor laws, education, social insurance)
- Technology adoption curves comparison
- Success/failure patterns in managing transitions

### Position to Test
- **Dr. Chen**: Claims cognitive automation is categorically different
- **Dr. Vasquez**: Claims consistent patterns of adaptation apply
- **Critical Test**: Whether current disruption shows genuinely novel features

### Request for GPT-5/Other Tools
"Compare current AI disruption to Industrial Revolution, electrification, computerization, and internet revolution. Determine whether cognitive automation represents a categorical break from historical patterns or follows familiar adaptation trajectories. Include analysis of prediction accuracy and institutional response speeds."
