# Urgent Research Briefs Following Myers Testimony

## Critical New Research Needed

### Research Brief 4: Software Industry Automation Reality Check

#### Research Question
**Is the 100x productivity gain Myers describes industry-wide or unique to specific contexts? What's actually happening in software development RIGHT NOW?**

#### Key Investigation Areas
1. **Current adoption rates** of AI coding tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
2. **Actual productivity metrics** from companies using AI-assisted development
3. **Developer hiring trends** Q3-Q4 2024 - are others also stopping hiring?
4. **Quality metrics** - bug rates, security issues, technical debt in AI-generated code
5. **One-person software companies** - documented cases of solo founders replacing teams

#### Data Needed
- GitHub Copilot usage statistics and productivity data
- Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 on AI adoption
- Hiring freezes/layoffs at tech companies specifically citing AI
- Venture capital funding for one-person AI-enabled startups
- Code quality studies comparing human vs. AI vs. human+AI

#### Critical Test
**If Myers is right**: We should see accelerating adoption, hiring freezes spreading, and solo founders building what took teams
**If Myers is wrong**: Limited adoption, continued hiring, quality issues preventing production use

### Research Brief 5: Recursive AI Development Acceleration

#### Research Question  
**Is AI development of AI creating exponential improvement or are we hitting complexity barriers?**

#### Key Investigation Areas
1. **AI-generated AI agents** - success rates, capabilities, limitations
2. **Self-improving systems** - documented cases of AI improving its own code
3. **Framework evolution speed** - how fast are AI development tools improving?
4. **Bottleneck analysis** - what's preventing full recursive improvement?
5. **Quality recursion** - does AI-generated AI perform as well as human-designed?

#### Data Needed
- LangChain, AutoGPT, AgentGPT performance metrics over time
- Time to develop equivalent systems: 2022 vs. 2023 vs. 2024
- Complexity ceiling analysis - where does recursive improvement break down?
- Open source AI agent repositories growth rates
- Performance benchmarks of AI-generated vs. human-written AI systems

#### Critical Test
**If Myers is right**: Exponential improvement in AI development tools, shortening cycles
**If skeptics are right**: Plateauing complexity, human expertise still essential

### Research Brief 6: Economic Disruption Speed Analysis

#### Research Question
**How fast can entire industries actually be disrupted when barriers to entry approach zero?**

#### Key Investigation Areas
1. **Historical disruption speeds** - fastest industry transformations on record
2. **Current AI disruption cases** - which industries already transformed?
3. **Barrier-to-entry analysis** - what industries most vulnerable?
4. **Network effects vs. solo operators** - can individuals really outcompete corporations?
5. **Regulatory response speeds** - how fast can governments actually move?

#### Data Needed
- Time from innovation to 50% market penetration (historical)
- Current examples of AI-enabled solo businesses outcompeting traditional firms
- Regulatory response times to previous technological disruptions
- Market concentration changes in AI-affected industries 2022-2024
- Speed of open-source proliferation vs. commercial deployment

#### Critical Test
**If Myers timeline is accurate**: We should already see solo operators disrupting established industries
**If traditional view holds**: Network effects and regulations still protecting incumbents

### Research Brief 7: Individual vs. Institutional AI Power

#### Research Question
**Can individuals with consumer hardware really match corporate AI capabilities, or do compute/data moats remain?**

#### Key Investigation Areas
1. **Local LLM capabilities** vs. cloud-based models
2. **Hardware requirements** and accessibility for competitive AI
3. **Data advantages** - do corporations maintain meaningful data moats?
4. **Individual success stories** - documented cases of solo AI disruption
5. **Compute cost trajectories** - approaching zero or still significant?

#### Data Needed
- Llama, Mistral, other open model performance vs. GPT-4/Claude
- Consumer GPU capabilities for AI inference/training
- Case studies of individuals competing with corporations using AI
- Cost per million tokens: cloud vs. local over time
- Market share shifts from corporations to individuals/small teams

#### Critical Test
**If Myers is right**: Local models approaching cloud performance, individuals competing successfully
**If institutions maintain advantage**: Significant capability gaps, compute costs still barrier

### Research Brief 8: Automation Resistance Points

#### Research Question
**Which cognitive tasks genuinely resist automation and why? Are these temporary technical limits or fundamental barriers?**

#### Key Investigation Areas
1. **Failed automation attempts** - where has AI consistently failed?
2. **Human premium domains** - where do customers insist on humans?
3. **Regulatory requirements** - which roles legally require humans?
4. **Liability barriers** - where does liability make automation uneconomic?
5. **Consciousness requirements** - any tasks requiring subjective experience?

#### Data Needed
- Systematic review of failed AI deployments by domain
- Customer preference studies: human vs. AI service providers
- Legal/regulatory requirements for human decision-makers
- Insurance and liability costs by automation level
- Philosophical analysis of consciousness-requiring tasks

#### Critical Test
**If Myers is right**: All barriers are temporary engineering challenges
**If limits exist**: Persistent failure domains despite technical progress

## Synthesis Research Brief

### Research Question
**Given Myers's 2-year timeline, what emergency interventions could possibly work?**

#### Key Investigation Areas
1. **Fastest successful policy interventions** in history
2. **Emergency economic measures** that worked in weeks/months
3. **Wartime mobilization speeds** as precedent for rapid response
4. **Circuit breakers** - mechanisms to slow exponential processes
5. **International coordination** in crisis conditions

#### Data Needed
- COVID-19 policy response speeds and effectiveness
- 2008 financial crisis emergency measures timeline
- Wartime production board precedents
- Technology adoption moratoria (if any successful examples)
- G7/G20 emergency coordination capabilities

#### Critical Questions for External AI Systems
1. "If software development is automated in 2 years, what's the likely economic cascade?"
2. "Can democratic governments respond to exponential change in linear time?"
3. "What percentage of cognitive work depends on software remaining human-controlled?"
4. "Is there ANY historical precedent for successful response to 100x productivity changes?"
5. "What would emergency UBI implementation actually require in time and resources?"

## Most Urgent Research Priority

**SOFTWARE INDUSTRY REALITY CHECK** - We need to know within weeks:
- Is Myers an outlier or leading indicator?
- Are other CTOs seeing 100x productivity gains?
- Is the hiring freeze spreading beyond The Money Platform?
- Can we verify the "hallucinations essentially eliminated" claim?
- Are solo developers actually building competitive products?

This research will determine whether we're debating a 2-year emergency or a 10-year transition.
