## Key Findings Log (Updated from Phase 1 Analysis)

### Strengths Identified
1. **Internal Consistency**: The thesis arguments flow logically from their premises
2. **Clear Framework**: Well-defined P vs NP analogy for understanding AI impact
3. **Specific Predictions**: Makes testable claims about verification divide
4. **Explains Current Phenomena**: Provides framework for AI anxiety, inequality, youth despair
5. **Novel Contributions**: COS framework and Verification Divide concept

### Vulnerabilities Identified
1. **The Verification Paradox**: Claims verification is rare but verifiers train their replacements
2. **The 5% Precision Problem**: Arbitrary number without derivation
3. **Cost Oversimplification**: 100x advantage ignores total costs
4. **Timeline Ambiguity**: No specific dates make claims unfalsifiable
5. **Binary Thinking**: Ignores spectrum of outcomes and adaptation

### Questions Requiring Research
1. What percentage of workers can actually verify AI output effectively?
2. Are there examples of new job categories created by AI?
3. What do employment statistics actually show in AI-heavy industries?
4. Is AI improvement truly exponential or showing signs of plateau?

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-09-02 | Use balanced approach, not pure refutation | Maintain intellectual honesty, thesis may be partially correct |
| 2025-09-02 | Start with empirical claims | These are most testable and objective |
| 2025-09-02 | Create research briefs before searching | Structured approach prevents confirmation bias |

## Quality Metrics

- **Balance Score**: Are we finding both supporting and contradicting evidence? ‚úÖ
- **Depth Score**: Are we addressing root assumptions, not just surface claims? ‚úÖ
- **Fairness Score**: Are we steel-manning arguments before critiquing? ‚úÖ
- **Evidence Quality**: Are sources credible and recent? (TBD after research)

---

## Notes and Observations

- The thesis is well-structured and internally consistent given its premises
- The key vulnerability appears to be untested empirical assumptions
- The "verification divide" concept is interesting but needs data
- The psychological framing (COS) is novel but lacks clinical validation
