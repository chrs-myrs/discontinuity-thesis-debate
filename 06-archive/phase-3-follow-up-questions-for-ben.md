# Phase 3: Follow-Up Questions for Ben Luong
## After His Initial Response

*These questions press on the gaps, contradictions, and evasions in Ben's response*

## On Timeline and Specificity

### 1. The Corpse That Still Moves
You declare capitalism "already a corpse" yet it continues functioning. When exactly does this corpse stop moving? 
- 2025? 2027? 2030? 
- At what unemployment rate does the "wage-demand circuit" actually break? 25%? 40%? 60%?
- If you can't specify when, how is this different from unfalsifiable doomsaying?

### 2. The Gradient Problem
You say AI cognition is "liquid" and ungovernable because it has no boundaries. But:
- Speed limits work despite speed being a gradient
- Age of consent laws work despite maturity being a gradient  
- Tax brackets work despite income being continuous
Why is AI cognition uniquely ungovernable when we successfully regulate other gradients?

## On Empirical Evidence

### 3. The Alaska Paradox
You dismiss Alaska's 40-year UBI as a "petting zoo" but it directly contradicts your thesis:
- $1,000-3,000 annual payments for 40 years
- Zero reduction in employment
- Increased entrepreneurship
- No "zoo animal" behavior observed

Why does 40 years of empirical data not count? What timeframe would convince you - 100 years? Never?

### 4. The Failure Rate Problem
Your model assumes frictionless AI deployment, but:
- 67% of enterprise AI projects fail (Report 2)
- Costs exceed estimates by 4.2x on average
- Hallucination rates remain 15-31% in professional domains
- Verification costs rising 30% annually while AI costs fall

How does Unit Cost Dominance work when the total cost of ownership is increasing?

## On the Mechanism

### 5. AI-Native Business Disruption
Chris Myers argues the real mechanism isn't gradual automation but AI-native businesses:
- One person + AI replacing entire industries
- Zero employee companies from day one
- No verification stage - just immediate replacement
- Already happening with solo developers beating agencies

This is MORE disruptive than your model. Why didn't you identify this mechanism? Does it accelerate or complicate your timeline?

### 6. The Partial Success Problem  
You reject any solution that isn't complete, but:
- Partial solutions buy adaptation time
- 30% employment preservation changes political dynamics entirely
- Mixed human-AI systems might be permanently optimal
- Some friction is sufficient to prevent collapse

Why must solutions be perfect rather than sufficient? Is 70% unemployment categorically identical to 100%?

## On Practical Implications

### 7. The "So What?" Question
Accepting your diagnosis, what should people actually DO?
- Learn to code? (But that's automating)
- Physical labor? (You call that "serfdom")  
- Politics? (You say it's "theater")
- Revolution? (Against what exactly - math?)

If your thesis offers no actionable path, isn't it just sophisticated nihilism?

### 8. The Self-Defeating Prophecy
If everyone believes your thesis:
- Mass panic accelerates timeline
- Preemptive policy responses change dynamics
- Investment patterns shift dramatically
- Self-fulfilling OR self-defeating prophecy?

How does widespread belief in the thesis affect the thesis itself?

## On Coordination

### 9. The China Question
China has:
- State control of AI development
- Ability to ban technologies overnight
- History of successful economic planning
- No "multiplayer prisoner's dilemma" internally

Can China prevent the discontinuity through central planning? If not, why not? If yes, doesn't that falsify "impossibility"?

### 10. The Professional Liability Shield
Medicine, law, and engineering maintain human requirements through liability:
- No insurance for pure AI diagnosis
- Malpractice requires human defendant
- Buildings need engineer stamps
- Courts require bar membership

These aren't "countable" like warheads but work anyway. Why won't liability frameworks create permanent human roles?

## The Meta-Challenge

### 11. The Rhetorical Strategy
Your response used:
- "Corpse" "masturbation" "priests" "petting zoo"
- Dismissal rather than engagement
- Rhetoric over data analysis
- Certainty without specificity

Is this intellectual rigor or emotional venting? How does calling experts "priests" advance truth-seeking?

### 12. The Falsification Retreat
Your original falsification criteria were specific. Now you're saying:
- UBI doesn't count (even though it maintains consumption)
- New jobs don't count (unless they scale to millions)
- Coordination doesn't count (because gradients)
- Adaptation doesn't count (unless perfect)

Are you moving goalposts or clarifying? What evidence would you actually accept?

## The Core Question

**You've diagnosed a disease and declared the patient dead while they're still walking and talking. The question isn't whether challenges exist - they clearly do. The question is whether your deterministic certainty is justified.**

Three specific requests:
1. **Give us a date**: When does unemployment hit 30%? 50%? Be specific.
2. **Engage the data**: Why do 40 years of UBI success not matter?
3. **Offer something actionable**: Beyond diagnosis, what should humanity actually do?

Without these, your thesis is unfalsifiable philosophy, not economic analysis.
