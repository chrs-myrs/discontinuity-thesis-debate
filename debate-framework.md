## Expert Panel Agents (Created âœ“)

### Core Debating Panel
1. **@dr-chen-inevitability** - The Discontinuity Advocate (Red)
2. **@dr-martinez-adaptation** - The Adaptation Economist (Blue)

## 6-Phase Debate Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation Setting (2 Rounds)
**Round 1A: Opening Positions**
- Each expert presents core thesis (500 words max)
- Must include 3 specific, testable predictions
- Identify key empirical claims that could falsify their position

**Round 1B: Disagreement Mapping**
- Identify core points of disagreement
- Prioritize which disagreements are most resolvable
- Commission research if needed

### Phase 2: Evidence Deep-Dive (4 Rounds)
**Rounds 2A-2D: Research-Driven Analysis**
- Experts can request specific research reports (2 per expert max)
- Address key empirical claims with evidence
- Focus on most contentious factual disputes

### Phase 3: Stress Testing (3 Rounds)
**Round 3A: Scenario Analysis**
- Test positions against specific scenarios
- "AI plateaus for 5 years", "Global coordination succeeds", "UBI scales nationally"

**Round 3B: Historical Precedent Analysis**
- Deep-dive on closest historical parallels
- Test claims of historical exceptionalism

**Round 3C: Policy Simulation**
- Analyze specific policy interventions
- Economic modeling of different approaches

### Phase 4: Cross-Examination (2 Rounds)
**Round 4A: Evidence Challenge**
- Each expert challenges others' strongest evidence
- Real-time fact-checking of major claims

**Round 4B: Assumption Testing**
- Examine hidden assumptions systematically
- Perspective-taking and bias checking

### Phase 5: Synthesis (2 Rounds)
**Round 5A: Convergence Analysis**
- Areas of agreement and remaining disagreements
- Updated probability assessments based on evidence

**Round 5B: Policy Recommendations**
- Actionable recommendations based on current evidence
- Priority research needed to resolve remaining questions

### Phase 6: Final Resolution (1 Round)
**Round 6: Truth Approximation**
- Final position statements with confidence levels
- Specific predictions for 1, 5, and 10 years
- Commitment to tracking and accountability

## Debate Commands

### Starting Debates
- `/debate start [phase]` - Begin specific debate phase
- `/debate round [phase][round]` - Start specific round (e.g., `/debate round 1a`)
- `/debate positions` - Get all experts' opening positions

### Expert Consultation
- `/ask @dr-chen-inevitability [question]` - Direct question to specific expert
- `/panel [topic]` - Get all experts' views on specific topic
- `/challenge @expert [claim]` - Challenge specific expert's claim

### Research and Evidence
- `/research [topic]` - Commission research report on topic
- `/evidence [claim]` - Request evidence for specific claim
- `/fact-check [statement]` - Verify factual claims

### Tracking and Analysis
- `/positions` - Current expert position summary
- `/disagreements` - Map current disagreements
- `/predictions` - Track all expert predictions
- `/convergence` - Analyze areas of agreement/disagreement

## Truth-Seeking Mechanisms

### Research Infrastructure
- Real-time research commission during debates
- Peer-review within 24 hours
- Methodology transparency requirements
- Sensitivity analysis for key assumptions

### Accountability Framework
- Structured prediction tracking
- Public probability assignments
- Regular position updates as evidence emerges
- Reputation scoring for accuracy

### Bias Mitigation
- Adversarial red-teaming exercises
- Each expert argues opponent's position once per phase
- External expert consultation for key disagreements
- Systematic assumption examination

### Evidence Standards
- **Tier 1**: Peer-reviewed studies, government data, established theory
- **Tier 2**: Working papers, industry reports, expert surveys
- **Tier 3**: Anecdotal evidence, opinion pieces, speculation

## Success Metrics

### Process Quality
- Logical consistency in final positions
- All major evidence claims addressed
- Explicit acknowledgment of uncertainties
- Complete investigation of key empirical questions

### Outcome Quality  
- Testable predictions with accountability
- Implementable policy recommendations
- External expert validation
- Convergence on key factual disputes

### Truth Approximation
- Position evolution based on evidence
- Falsifiable positions vulnerable to data
- Practical relevance for real-world decisions
- Long-term validity under future evidence

## Usage Instructions

1. **Initialize Debate**: `/debate start phase1` to begin structured debate
2. **Expert Consultation**: Use @mentions to invoke specific expert perspectives
3. **Research Requests**: Use `/research [topic]` when experts need empirical evidence
4. **Track Progress**: Use `/positions` and `/convergence` to monitor debate evolution
5. **Challenge Claims**: Use `/challenge @expert [claim]` for adversarial testing

The framework prioritizes intellectual honesty over rhetorical victory, evidence over speculation, and practical truth-seeking over academic point-scoring.
