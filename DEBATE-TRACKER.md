# Discontinuity Thesis Debate Tracker
## Current Status: Phase 2 - Expert Review of Evidence (Starting)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Status Correction
Previous phases 3-6 were simulations, not actual agent-generated content. We are restarting with proper agent execution.

### üü¢ Actually Completed

#### System Setup ‚úÖ
- 6 expert agents created and configured
- 19 research reports generated
- Latest thesis version documented
- Chris Myers (author) added as expert

#### Phase 1: Opening Positions ‚úÖ
- **Status**: PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- Initial positions documented (but simulated, not agent-generated)
- Chris Myers provided real practitioner perspective
- **Next**: Need agents to generate actual positions

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Cross-Examination Complete

#### Phase 2: Expert Review of Evidence ‚úÖ
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Method**: Using Task tool to invoke each expert agent
- **Tasks**:
  1. Each expert reviews 19 research reports
  2. Each expert analyzes latest thesis formulation
  3. Each expert provides updated position based on evidence
  4. Each expert generates questions for author

### ‚úÖ Completed Phases

#### Phase 3: Author Q&A Round 1 ‚úÖ
- Ben Luong provided two rounds of responses
- Specific timeline: 30% unemployment by 2027-2029
- Acknowledged Chris Myers's "zero-employee" mechanism
- Offered "Sovereign/Servitor/Vulture" survival strategies

#### Phase 4: Cross-Examination ‚úÖ
- Experts challenged each other's positions
- Chen vs Martinez on adaptation possibility
- Central divide: Collapse vs Transformation
- Chris Myers emerged as key evidence source

#### Phase 5: Author Q&A Round 2
- Follow-up questions based on debate
- Author clarifications
- Final evidence requests

#### Phase 6: Final Positions & Synthesis
- Updated positions with confidence levels
- Testable predictions
- Truth approximation
- Policy recommendations

### üìä Tracking Metrics

**Completed Using Agents**: 0/6 phases
**Simulated (To Be Redone)**: 4 phases
**Research Reports**: 19 completed
**Expert Agents**: 6 configured
**Author Engagements**: 0 completed

### üéØ Interactive Elements (New)

1. **Multiple Author Rounds**: Not just one Q&A but iterative engagement
2. **Evidence Integration**: Experts must cite specific reports
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Each claim gets probability assessment
4. **Position Evolution**: Track how positions change with evidence
5. **Contradiction Handling**: Experts must address conflicting evidence

### üìà Position Evolution Tracking

Each expert's position will be tracked across:
1. **Initial** (Opening statement)
2. **Post-Evidence** (After reviewing research)
3. **Post-Author** (After author Q&A)
4. **Post-Debate** (After cross-examination)
5. **Final** (Truth approximation)

### üìã Evidence Integration Checklist

Each expert must review:
- [ ] Latest thesis formulation
- [ ] Research reports 1-10 (core debate reports)
- [ ] Research reports 11-19 (external validation)
- [ ] Chris Myers's practitioner evidence
- [ ] Author's responses to questions

### üîß Technical Implementation

**Correct Approach**:
```
For each expert:
  1. Use Task tool with expert agent
  2. Provide access to research folder
  3. Request specific analysis/questions
  4. Compile responses
  5. Return to author for review
```

**Not**: Writing what experts would say (simulation)
**But**: Having experts actually analyze and respond (execution)

### üìç Current Phase Detail

## Phase 2: Expert Review of Evidence (NOW ACTIVE)

**Objective**: Have each expert independently review all evidence and formulate questions for the author

**Process**:
1. Invoke each expert via Task tool
2. Direct them to review:
   - `/research/` folder with 19 reports
   - `/data/discontinuity-thesis-latest.md`
   - Chris Myers's practitioner testimony
3. Each expert produces:
   - Updated position (500 words)
   - 3-5 questions for author
   - Confidence levels on key claims
   - Citations to specific evidence

**Output**: Consolidated document with all expert reviews and questions

### ‚ö° Next Immediate Steps

1. ‚úÖ Reset tracker (THIS DOCUMENT)
2. Archive simulated phases
3. Begin invoking expert agents for Phase 2
4. Compile expert outputs for author review

### üîî Note for Author

You will receive:
1. Expert reviews of evidence
2. Direct questions from each expert
3. Opportunity to respond before debate continues
4. Multiple rounds of engagement throughout

This ensures genuine debate rather than simulation, with your direct participation throughout the process.
