# Falsification Criteria for the Discontinuity Thesis
## From https://discontinuitythesis.com/proof/

Ben Luong has specified precise requirements for falsifying the Discontinuity Thesis:

## Requirements for Falsification

To falsify the thesis, one must **simultaneously prove**:

### 1. Cognitive Ladder Restoration
New work categories must emerge that are:
- **AI-resistant**: Tasks AI cannot perform effectively
- **Wage-sustaining**: Paying $40,000+ annually  
- **Scalable**: Employable for millions, not just thousands
- **Genuinely productive**: Creating real economic value, not make-work

### 2. Mass Productive Participation
Demonstrate that 50%+ of working-age adults can obtain employment that:
- Requires human capabilities demonstrably superior to AI
- Creates genuine economic value (not subsidized)
- Emerges from competitive market forces (not regulation)
- Cannot be arbitraged away by AI adoption

### 3. Coordination Solution
Solve the Multiplayer Prisoner's Dilemma by showing:
- Binding international agreements are achievable
- Enforcement mechanisms can prevent competitive defection
- Stable task boundaries between human and AI work
- Individual incentives align with collective good

### 4. Democratic Economic Agency
Show political democracy can function when:
- 50%+ of population depends on transfers
- Economic value concentrates in AI systems controlled by <5%
- Masses retain meaningful political influence despite economic irrelevance
- Democratic institutions resist capture by economic elite

## Explicitly Disqualified Approaches

The following do NOT constitute falsification:
- **Capital redistribution schemes** (doesn't restore productive participation)
- **UBI** (manages non-participation, doesn't prevent it)
- **Temporary job refuges** (delays but doesn't prevent)
- **Regulatory solutions** (can be arbitraged internationally)
- **Redefining capitalism** (changes system, doesn't save it)

## Mathematical Constraints

For falsification, must demonstrate:
- AI unit costs remain permanently higher than human labor for significant work
- Rate of new job creation exceeds rate of AI capability expansion
- Coordination mechanisms that survive competitive pressure mathematically

## Burden of Proof

The burden is demonstrating "mass productive employment" persists, not just:
- Alternative income sources
- Wealth redistribution
- New economic systems
- Temporary adaptations

The thesis claims capitalism's wage-labor circuit fundamentally breaks. Falsification requires showing this circuit remains intact despite AI achieving unit cost dominance.

## Key Insight

Ben's falsification criteria essentially require proving that humans retain permanent comparative advantage in economically valuable tasks at scale - not just niche roles or subsidized positions, but genuine mass employment emerging from market forces despite AI's cost advantages.
