# The Discontinuity Thesis - Latest Version
## Unit Cost Dominance and the Collapse of Post-WWII Capitalism

The Discontinuity Thesis argues for the collapse of Post-WWII capitalism due to Unit Cost Dominance (UCD).

## Core Definition
**DEFINITION**: UCD is the economic condition where an AI + human verifier produces cognitive work at a significantly lower marginal cost than a human. In cognitive domains (bits, e.g., law), this leads to 50-100x cost reduction and mass REPLACEMENT. In physical domains (atoms, e.g., plumbing), it's a 1.5-2x efficiency gain and AUGMENTATION. The marginal inference cost is all that matters.

## The Core Mechanism

### P1 (The Math)
Competitive adoption is inevitable. The only refutation is to prove one of the following: 
- Verification costs don't scale
- AI quality gaps are permanent
- Markets will choose higher-cost humans
- A binding global coordination is possible
- A massive physical job refuge exists

### P2 (The Trap)
Coordination to prevent this is impossible. It's not one prisoner's dilemma, but billions played out daily at international, corporate, and individual levels. The boundary between "assistance" and "replacement" is a Sorites paradox—undefinable and impossible to regulate.

### P3 (The Collapse & End of Participation)
The wage-demand circuit that powers capitalism breaks. Production without wages means products without consumers. This is the collapse of productive participation. UBI is not a solution but management for a population without economic function or democratic agency—zoo animals in a curated enclosure.

## Downstream Effects

### 1. THE DISSOLUTION
UCD dismantles the pillars of the post-WWII era:
- Upward mobility (the cognitive ladder is gone)
- Market-based wages (the floor is AI's marginal cost)  
- Democratic agency (economic leverage vanishes)

### 2. THE PSYCHOLOGY (COS)
Cognitive Obsolescence Syndrome is the accurate perception of this reality. Society victim-blames with futile "retraining" against an exponential curve.

### 3. THE POLITICS (SCAPEGOAT CYCLE)
Political systems invent visible enemies (immigrants, China) to channel rage away from the invisible force of UCD.

### 4. THE KNOWLEDGE TRAP
Knowing doesn't help. Political tools are human-speed solutions for a machine-speed problem. Protesting UCD is like asking a physicist to protest gravity.
