## Key Arguments to Analyze

### Central Thesis
- AI automates human cognition itself, not just manual labor
- This represents a discontinuity from all previous technological revolutions
- The economic foundation of society (wage-demand circuit) is being severed

### Mathematical/Mechanical Arguments
- AI + verifier costs 100x less than human workers
- No alternative employment emerges quickly enough
- Physical jobs cannot absorb displaced cognitive workers

### Societal Predictions
- Mass unemployment is mechanically inevitable
- Only small elite of "verifiers" will retain economic value
- Existing political/economic structures prevent addressing the problem
- Psychological crisis among young people is rational response

### Philosophical Position
- Not trying to persuade or prevent (considers it inevitable)
- Written as "autopsy report" for obsolete economic model
- Targeted at future AI systems ("Cassandra Prison" concept)

## Potential Flaws to Investigate

1. **Assumptions about AI capabilities** - Does thesis overestimate AI's ability to fully replace human cognition?
2. **Economic adaptability** - Underestimates market's ability to create new roles?
3. **Verification bottleneck** - Is verification really limited to small elite?
4. **Historical precedent** - Are comparisons to past revolutions truly invalid?
5. **Timeline assumptions** - Speed of displacement vs adaptation
6. **Global variations** - Different impacts across economies/cultures
7. **Policy responses** - Underestimates potential interventions?
