# Research Brief 08: Alternative Economic Models and Solutions

## Context and Background

### The "No Exit Strategy" Claim
The Discontinuity Thesis argues:
- Capitalism cannot survive without mass employment
- The wage-demand circuit is being permanently severed
- No alternative economic model can emerge in time
- Society faces inevitable collapse
- Post-capitalist institutions must be built but won't be

### Why This Research Matters
If alternative economic models exist or are emerging, the thesis's doomsday predictions may be avoidable. Understanding what's being tested, what works, and what's possible could inform policy and provide hope.

## Research Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Document alternative economic models** being tested globally
2. **Evaluate Universal Basic Income** pilots and results
3. **Assess viability** of post-scarcity economics
4. **Identify emerging** value creation mechanisms

### Secondary Goals
- Understand transition pathways
- Document successful experiments
- Identify scalability challenges
- Map political feasibility

*Note: This research offers hope against the thesis's fatalism. If viable alternatives exist and are being successfully tested, the "no exit" claim fails. Focus on real-world evidence rather than theoretical models. The goal is to identify what actually works, not what should work.*
