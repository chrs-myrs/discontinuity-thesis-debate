# Research Brief 01: AI Adoption and Employment Impact Studies

## Context and Background

### The Discontinuity Thesis Claims
A controversial thesis called "The Discontinuity Thesis" argues that artificial intelligence represents a fundamental break from all previous technological revolutions, leading to inevitable mass unemployment. The thesis makes several specific claims about AI's impact on employment:

1. **Mass unemployment is mechanically inevitable** due to AI's cost advantages
2. **AI + human verifier costs 100x less** than traditional human labor
3. **No new job categories will emerge fast enough** to absorb displaced workers
4. **The wage-demand circuit of capitalism is being severed** permanently

### Why This Research Matters
We need empirical data to test whether these dramatic claims align with actual employment trends in AI-adopting industries. This research will help determine if AI is truly different from previous technological disruptions or following historical patterns of creative destruction.

## Research Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Quantify actual employment changes** in industries with high AI adoption (2020-2024)
2. **Identify new job categories** created by AI deployment
3. **Analyze wage trends** in AI-exposed vs non-exposed occupations
4. **Measure the ratio** of jobs created to jobs displaced by AI

### Secondary Goals
- Understand the timeline of employment transitions
- Identify which job types are most/least affected
- Document regional and industry variations
- Find early indicators of broader trends

## Specific Research Questions

### Employment Statistics
1. What are the actual unemployment rates in tech-heavy sectors that have adopted AI tools?
2. Has employment grown, shrunk, or remained stable in companies that heavily use AI?
3. What percentage of workers have been directly displaced by AI systems?
4. How do these numbers compare to predictions made 2-3 years ago?

### Job Creation vs Destruction
1. What new job titles have emerged since 2020 that didn't exist before?
2. How many people are employed in AI-related roles (prompt engineers, AI trainers, etc.)?
3. What is the net job creation/destruction ratio in AI-adopting companies?
4. Are there specific industries showing job growth despite AI adoption?

### Wage Impact Analysis
1. Are wages declining in occupations heavily exposed to AI competition?
2. What is the wage premium/discount for AI-complementary skills?
3. How have wage distributions changed within companies adopting AI?
4. Is there evidence of the predicted "verification divide" in wages?

### Transition Dynamics
1. How long does it take for displaced workers to find new employment?
2. What percentage successfully transition to new roles vs leaving the workforce?
3. Are retraining programs showing measurable success?
4. What factors predict successful vs unsuccessful transitions?

### Data-Specific Queries
- BLS OES (Occupational Employment Statistics) for specific occupation codes
- O*NET database for emerging occupation classifications
- JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) data
- Current Population Survey (CPS) microdata

## Evaluation Criteria

### Source Credibility Assessment
- **High Credibility**: Government statistics, peer-reviewed studies, large-sample surveys
- **Medium Credibility**: Industry reports, think tank research, company data
- **Low Credibility**: News articles, blog posts, small surveys, opinion pieces

### Data Quality Requirements
- Sample size > 1000 for surveys
- Time period covering at least 2020-2024
- Clear methodology disclosed
- Distinction between correlation and causation
- Control for confounding factors (COVID-19, economic cycles)

## Output Format Requirements

### Executive Summary (1 page)
- Key findings in bullet points
- Overall assessment: Do findings support or contradict the thesis?
- Confidence level in conclusions
- Critical data gaps identified

### Detailed Findings (5-10 pages)
1. **Employment Impact Data**
   - Quantitative statistics with sources
   - Industry and occupation breakdowns
   - Timeline of changes

2. **Job Creation Analysis**
   - New occupation categories identified
   - Growth rates and projections
   - Quality of new jobs (wages, stability)

3. **Wage Trend Analysis**
   - Comparative wage data
   - Distribution changes
   - Skill premium evolution

4. **Transition Patterns**
   - Worker mobility data
   - Retraining success rates
   - Demographic variations

### Data Tables
- Summary statistics table
- Year-over-year comparison
- Industry sector breakdown

### Limitations and Caveats
- Data availability constraints
- Methodological limitations
- Confounding factors
- Areas needing further research

## Critical Analysis Points

### Test These Specific Claims
1. **"100x cost advantage"**: Find actual cost comparisons between AI and human workers
2. **"No new jobs"**: Document all new job categories since 2020
3. **"Mass unemployment"**: Check if unemployment is rising in AI-heavy sectors
4. **"Wage collapse"**: Verify if wages are declining as predicted

### Look for Counter-Evidence
- Industries where AI increased employment
- Successful human-AI collaboration models
- Wage growth in AI-complementary roles
- Evidence of adaptation and resilience

### Consider Alternative Explanations
- Could employment changes be due to other factors?
- Are we seeing augmentation rather than replacement?
- Is the timeline longer than the thesis suggests?
- Are there cultural/regulatory factors limiting AI adoption?
