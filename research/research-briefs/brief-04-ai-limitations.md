# Research Brief 04: AI Capability Limitations and Plateau Evidence

## Context and Background

### The Exponential Improvement Assumption
The Discontinuity Thesis rests heavily on the assumption that:
- AI capabilities will continue improving exponentially
- There are no meaningful boundaries to what AI can do
- Any current limitations are temporary
- The "Engine of Obsolescence" will mechanically continue

If AI capabilities are plateauing, have hard limits, or face increasing costs, the thesis's predictions may not materialize.

### Why This Research Matters
Understanding actual AI limitations versus hype is crucial for:
- Realistic workforce planning
- Investment decisions
- Policy development
- Individual career choices
- Evaluating dystopian predictions

## Research Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Identify current hard limits** of AI systems
2. **Assess evidence** for exponential improvement vs plateau
3. **Document hidden costs** of AI deployment
4. **Map tasks** that remain stubbornly human

### Secondary Goals
- Understand theoretical limits of current approaches
- Identify unexpected failure modes
- Document maintenance and oversight costs
- Project realistic capability trajectories

## Specific Research Questions

### Current Capability Boundaries
1. What tasks do state-of-the-art AI systems consistently fail at?
2. Are there fundamental limitations to transformer-based architectures?
3. What problems require capabilities current AI lacks?
4. How do AI systems perform on truly novel problems?

### Plateau vs Exponential Growth
1. **Benchmark Analysis**: Are AI benchmark improvements slowing?
2. **Scaling Laws**: Are we hitting diminishing returns on model size?
3. **Data Limitations**: Are we running out of training data?
4. **Compute Costs**: Is the cost of improvement becoming prohibitive?
5. **Energy Constraints**: Are power requirements becoming unsustainable?

### Hidden Costs and Failures
1. What are the real total costs of AI deployment including:
   - Initial implementation
   - Ongoing maintenance
   - Error correction
   - Human oversight
   - Retraining and updates
   - Infrastructure requirements

2. What failure rates do production AI systems exhibit?
3. How much human intervention is required in practice?
4. What are the liability and insurance costs?

### Persistent Human Advantages
1. What cognitive capabilities resist automation?
   - Common sense reasoning
   - Contextual understanding
   - Ethical judgment
   - Creative problem-solving
   - Emotional intelligence
   - Physical world interaction

2. Are these advantages fundamental or temporary?
3. What tasks require capabilities AI may never achieve?

### Technical Limitations
1. **Hallucination Problem**: Can it be solved or is it inherent?
2. **Reasoning Limitations**: Can AI truly reason or just pattern match?
3. **Generalization Failures**: Why do AI systems fail outside training distribution?
4. **Interpretability**: Can we ever trust AI decisions we don't understand?
5. **Alignment Problem**: Can AI goals be reliably aligned with human values?
