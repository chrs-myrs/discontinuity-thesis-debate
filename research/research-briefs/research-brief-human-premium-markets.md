# Research Brief: Human Premium Markets
## Research Questions on Willingness to Pay for Human-Made Products

---

## Context for External Researcher

**Background**: The "Discontinuity Thesis" argues that AI will cause economic collapse through "Unit Cost Dominance" - AI producing cognitive work at 50-100x lower cost than humans, leading to mass unemployment by 2027-2029. This research evaluates a key counter-argument: that consumers will pay premiums for human-made products/services, creating sustainable employment niches.

**Debate Stakes**: Ben Luong (thesis author) claims premium markets are "elite consumption" supporting <5% of workers. Critics argue premiums could sustain 10-20% employment through luxury, artisanal, and trust-based markets. The question is whether premiums can scale to millions of jobs, not just thousands.

**Key Tensions**: 
- Will Gen Z/Alpha maintain human preferences as AI quality improves?
- Can premiums survive economic downturns when consumers prioritize cost?
- Do premiums create real employment or just inequality?

**Decision Impact**: Results will inform whether policymakers should:
- Invest in protecting/promoting human-made markets
- Focus on alternative solutions (UBI, job guarantees)
- Accept premium markets as partial but insufficient solution

## Research Objective

Determine whether premium pricing for human-made products and services can create sustainable employment at scale in an AI-dominated economy.

## Primary Research Questions

### 1. Market Size and Segmentation
- What percentage of consumers currently pay premiums for explicitly human-made products?
- What are the price elasticities for human vs AI-produced goods across categories?
- How large are premium markets relative to total employment needs?

### 2. Premium Persistence 
- Are human premiums increasing, stable, or declining over time?
- How do premiums vary across industries and product categories?
- What is the half-life of premium categories before commoditization?

### 3. Generational Differences
- How do Gen Z and Gen Alpha consumers value human vs AI creation?
- Are younger consumers more or less willing to pay human premiums?
- What cultural factors influence generational preferences?

## Specific Metrics Needed

### Quantitative
- Premium percentages by category (% price difference human vs AI)
- Market share of premium segments by industry
- Employment numbers in premium-dependent sectors
- Growth rates of human-certified products
- Consumer surplus from human interaction

### Qualitative
- Consumer motivations for choosing human-made
- Trust factors in human vs AI services
- Cultural attitudes toward automation
- Perceived quality differences
- Social signaling value of human consumption

## Research Methodology Requirements

### Surveys Needed
- Large-scale consumer preference studies (n>10,000)
- Willingness-to-pay experiments with real products
- Cross-cultural comparison studies
- Longitudinal tracking of preference changes

### Natural Experiments
- Before/after AI introduction in specific markets
- Geographic variation in AI adoption
- Regulatory differences creating comparison groups
- Platform A/B tests of human vs AI services

### Case Studies Required
- Industries that successfully maintained human premiums
- Failed attempts at premiumization
- Transition patterns from human to AI
- Regulatory interventions affecting premiums

## Critical Unknown Variables

1. **Threshold Effects**: At what AI quality level do premiums collapse?
2. **Income Requirements**: What inequality level needed to sustain premiums?
3. **Scale Limits**: Maximum employment sustainable through premiums?
4. **Cultural Variation**: How do premiums vary across societies?
5. **Recession Resilience**: Do premiums survive economic downturns?

## Hypothesis to Test

**H1**: Human premiums exist but can only sustain <10% of current employment
**H2**: Premiums are generation-dependent and declining with younger cohorts
**H3**: Premium markets require top 10% income inequality to function
**H4**: Regulatory mandates create more sustainable employment than market premiums
**H5**: Human premiums follow power law distribution (few large, many small)

## Timeline and Priority

### Immediate (1-3 months)
- Collect existing market research reports
- Analyze current premium pricing data
- Survey consumer preferences

### Short-term (3-6 months)
- Conduct willingness-to-pay experiments
- Analyze generational differences
- Model employment implications

### Long-term (6-12 months)
- Track premium evolution over time
- Test recession resilience
- Project 5-year scenarios
