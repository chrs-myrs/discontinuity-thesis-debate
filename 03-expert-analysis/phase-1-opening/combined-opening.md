## Phase 1A: Opening Positions (Complete)

### Dr. Marcus "Inevitability" Chen - Discontinuity Advocate

#### Core Thesis
**"The discontinuity is not coming—it's already here, mechanically unfolding through observable unit cost dominance."**

We are witnessing the collapse of cognitive work's economic value in real-time. AI has achieved unit cost dominance across cognitive tasks: GPT-4 produces marketing copy for $0.02 versus $50 for human freelancers, legal document generation has dropped from $200/hour to $2/document, and GitHub Copilot now completes 40%+ of developer code.

The multiplayer defection problem makes coordination impossible. With open-source models downloaded millions of times, we have billions of individual economic actors who can defect. History demonstrates this: climate coordination (30+ years, minimal progress), tax avoidance (complete failure), nuclear proliferation (predictable spread).

#### Key Evidence
1. **Unit Cost Dominance**: Content creation AI at $0.01-0.10 vs humans at $50-200
2. **Coordination Failure**: Llama models downloaded 15+ million times despite restrictions
3. **Wage Collapse Beginning**: Content marketing jobs down 23% YoY, junior developer hiring frozen at 67% of tech companies

#### Predictions
- **1-2 years (95% confidence)**: 15-20% cognitive job displacement
- **3-5 years (85% confidence)**: Major economy implements crisis UBI, coordination breakdown
- **5-10 years (70% confidence)**: 25%+ mass cognitive unemployment

#### Would Change Mind If
- AI development plateau lasting 5+ years
- Successful international coordination with enforcement
- Evidence of permanent human cognitive advantages
- New economic sectors absorbing displaced workers at scale

### Dr. Sarah "Resilience" Martinez - Adaptation Economist

#### Core Thesis
**"The Discontinuity Thesis confuses early adoption patterns with inevitable dominance while ignoring massive counter-evidence of successful adaptation."**

Current AI cost advantages are narrow and domain-specific. Markets are not natural phenomena—they are institutional constructions we routinely modify. Professional licensing prevents races-to-bottom while maintaining competition. The EU's GDPR successfully regulated global tech. Basel Accords coordinate financial regulation globally.

#### Key Evidence
1. **Hidden Costs**: 73% of companies need human verification, increasing costs 35-60% over pure human labor
2. **Coordination Success**: Montreal Protocol 100% compliance, medical licensing works globally
3. **Alternative Models**: Alaska PFD 40+ years with employment, Mondragón €12 billion cooperative

#### Predictions
- **1-2 years (85% confidence)**: EU AI Act triggers adoption in 15+ countries
- **3-5 years (75% confidence)**: Regional UBI shows increased participation, not dependency
- **5-10 years (60% confidence)**: Professional licensing regulates AI, quality premiums persist

#### Would Change Mind If
- Multiple coordination attempts fail despite incentives
- AI dominance across 80%+ domains including verification costs
- Alternative models fail to scale beyond pilots
- Institutional adaptation proves structurally insufficient

### Dr. Raj "Limits" Patel - Technology Realist

#### Core Thesis
**"The thesis conflates narrow task automation with general cognitive replacement, ignoring exponential verification costs and technical plateaus."**

The "already happening" narrative cherry-picks demos while ignoring deployment failures. Professional deployment requires 1:1 human oversight in high-stakes domains. GPT-4's improvements over GPT-3 were smaller than GPT-3 over GPT-2, suggesting diminishing returns. Hallucination rates remain 15-30% despite massive investment.

#### Key Evidence
1. **Verification Cascade**: Legal/medical AI requires human review, often taking longer than original work
2. **Technical Plateaus**: Training costs exponential (GPT-3: $4.6M, GPT-4: ~$63M) while gains diminish
3. **Collaboration Advantage**: GitHub Copilot most effective with experienced programmers, not replacing juniors

#### Predictions
- **1-2 years (85% confidence)**: Verification costs rise >20% annually while AI costs drop <50%
- **3-5 years (70% confidence)**: No major profession achieves >50% automation without human oversight
- **5-10 years (60% confidence)**: Current architectures plateau before reliable AGI

#### Would Change Mind If
- Breakthrough architecture enables reliable AGI
- Verification costs collapse
- Regulatory acceptance of autonomous AI in high-stakes domains
- Hidden costs decrease rather than increase with scale

### Dr. Elena "Precedent" Vasquez - Historical Comparativist

#### Core Thesis
**"Current disruption follows well-documented patterns of technological revolution and adaptation, not unprecedented discontinuity."**

Every revolution was perceived as uniquely threatening by contemporaries. Herbert Simon predicted computers would eliminate most jobs by 1985—wrong. The same communication technologies enabling AI also enable rapid regulatory coordination. Crisis periods activate latent coordination capacity.

#### Key Evidence
1. **Failed Predictions**: 1960s computer unemployment predictions, Luddite fears all proved wrong
2. **Adaptation Acceleration**: Software engineering 0 to 4.4 million jobs in 30 years
3. **Coordination Success**: ILO conventions globally adopted, Montreal Protocol succeeded

#### Predictions
- **1-2 years (85% confidence)**: Job transformation exceeds elimination in AI sectors
- **3-5 years (75% confidence)**: International AI coordination frameworks function
- **5-10 years (70% confidence)**: New job categories employ >10 million globally

#### Would Change Mind If
- Cognitive automation proves mechanistically different
- Adaptation capacity structurally slower than change
- Historical coordination examples were actually ineffective
- Sustained >15% unemployment for >5 years

### Dr. James "Solutions" Thompson - Coordination Theorist

#### Core Thesis
**"The coordination problem is solvable through proper institutional design and incentive alignment."**

AI displacement is not mechanically inevitable—it's a coordination challenge with known solutions. Professional licensing maintains quality standards globally. Basel Accords prevent regulatory arbitrage. Insurance markets price AI liability, creating natural oversight incentives.

#### Key Evidence
1. **Professional Standards**: Medical/legal/engineering licensing works despite competition
2. **International Frameworks**: Basel III coordinates 28 countries successfully
3. **Liability Incentives**: Insurance offers 15-30% lower premiums for human oversight

#### Predictions
- **1-2 years (90% confidence)**: 5+ jurisdictions establish AI oversight requirements
- **3-5 years (80% confidence)**: International AI governance framework emerges
- **5-10 years (70% confidence)**: Human-verified services command 20-40% premium

#### Would Change Mind If
- Multiple well-designed coordination attempts fail
- Competitive pressures override all mechanisms
- Technology permanently outpaces institutions
- No incentive design aligns individual/collective interests

## Phase 1B: Disagreement Mapping (Complete)

### Primary Disagreement: Coordination Feasibility

**Core Question**: Can institutions coordinate AI deployment to prevent displacement?

**Positions**:
- Chen: Impossible (95% confidence) - billions of defectors
- Martinez/Thompson: Achievable (75-80% confidence) - licensing works
- Vasquez: Historical success (75% confidence) - precedents exist

**Test**: EU AI Act implementation over 12 months

### Secondary Disagreement: Speed and Inevitability

**Core Question**: Is displacement already mechanically inevitable?

**Positions**:
- Chen: Already happening (90% confidence)
- Patel: Technical limits slow it (75% confidence)
- Others: Manageable transition (70-85% confidence)

**Test**: Actual displacement vs. transformation rates

### Third Disagreement: Alternative Economic Models

**Core Question**: Can UBI/cooperatives maintain participation?

**Positions**:
- Chen: Creates dependency (70% confidence against)
- Martinez: Alaska proves it works (85% confidence for)

**Test**: Long-term UBI employment data

### Fourth Disagreement: Technical Trajectory

**Core Question**: Will AI continue exponential improvement?

**Positions**:
- Chen: Exponential continues (85% confidence)
- Patel: Plateaus evident (75% confidence)

**Test**: GPT-5 performance vs. cost trends

2. **All agree pure laissez-faire insufficient**
3. **All recognize professional domains need oversight**
4. **All acknowledge uncertainty, need research**

## Research Priorities Identified

1. **Professional Licensing Effectiveness** - addresses coordination dispute
2. **True Cost of AI Deployment** - addresses speed/inevitability
