# Research Report 15: AI Capability Limitations and Plateau Evidence
## External Research Report

### Source
Original research conducted externally and provided as PDF: "AI Capability Limitations and Plateau Evidence.pdf"

### Executive Summary
Technical analysis of current AI limitations, evidence of capability plateaus, and fundamental challenges that may constrain future development.

### Key Findings
- Scaling laws showing diminishing returns
- Persistent problems with reasoning and causality
- Data quality becoming limiting factor
- Energy and compute constraints emerging
- Verification costs growing exponentially

### Relevance to Debate
Critical technical grounding that challenges assumptions about continued exponential improvement. Strongly supports:
- Patel's technical skepticism
- Quality and verification concerns
- Resistance points in complex domains
- Challenges to recursive self-improvement

### Status
Full report available as PDF in /research/outputs/

### Integration Notes
Technical reality check that tempers more aggressive automation predictions and timeline estimates.
