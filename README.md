## The Debate

### The Thesis
The Discontinuity Thesis argues that AI's achievement of Unit Cost Dominance (50-100x cost reduction in cognitive work) makes mass unemployment mechanically inevitable through:
1. Competitive adoption pressure (prisoner's dilemma)
2. Coordination impossibility at scale
3. Breakdown of capitalism's wage-demand circuit

### The Expert Panel

**Six experts examining the thesis from different angles:**

1. **Dr. Marcus Chen** (@dr-chen-inevitability) - Mathematical economist defending the thesis
2. **Dr. Elena Martinez** (@dr-martinez-adaptation) - Institutional economist arguing for adaptation
3. **Dr. Raj Patel** (@dr-patel-tech-realist) - AI researcher emphasizing technical limitations
4. **Dr. Sofia Vasquez** (@dr-vasquez-historian) - Economic historian providing precedent
5. **Dr. James Thompson** (@dr-thompson-coordination) - Game theorist designing solutions
6. **Chris Myers** (@chris-myers-practitioner) - CTO with real-world automation experience

### Current Status

**Phase 2: Expert Evidence Review** (In Progress)
- Experts reviewing 19 research reports
- Analyzing latest thesis formulation
- Generating questions for author

See [DEBATE-TRACKER.md](DEBATE-TRACKER.md) for detailed progress.

## Key Findings So Far

### Areas of Agreement
- AI disruption in software is real and rapid (1-3 years)
- Coordination faces serious challenges
- Hybrid human-AI models likely medium-term
- Political response will be critical

### Areas of Dispute
- Timeline for broader disruption (2-50 years)
- Human agency vs technological determinism
- Effectiveness of adaptation mechanisms
- Role of physical work as employment refuge

## Research Base

**19 comprehensive reports covering:**
- AI capabilities and limitations
- Deployment costs and verification
- Historical precedents
- UBI experiments
- Alternative economic models
- Global variations
- Psychological impacts

See [/research/README.md](research/README.md) for complete index.

## Methodology

The debate follows a structured 6-phase process:
1. Opening positions
2. Evidence review
3. Author Q&A
4. Cross-examination
5. Follow-up Q&A
6. Final synthesis

See [debate-framework.md](debate-framework.md) for complete methodology.

## Interactive Elements

- Multiple rounds of author engagement
- Expert agents analyze evidence independently
- Confidence scoring on all claims
- Position evolution tracking
- Testable predictions with accountability
