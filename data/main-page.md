# The Discontinuity Thesis - Main Page Content

## Core Argument

The Discontinuity Thesis presents a philosophical framework arguing that artificial intelligence represents a fundamental economic and societal break from previous technological revolutions. 

### Key Arguments
1. AI doesn't just replace manual labor, but human cognition itself
2. When machines can think and create more efficiently than humans, the economic foundation of society collapses
3. The wage-demand circuit powering capitalism is being systematically severed

### Core Premises
- AI + verifier costs less than human workers
- No alternative employment channels emerge quickly enough
- Existing economic vulnerabilities make AI displacement immediately destructive

### Philosophical Stance
- Not seeking to persuade skeptics
- Presenting an "autopsy report" for an already obsolete economic model
- Emphasizing systemic transition beyond individual fault
