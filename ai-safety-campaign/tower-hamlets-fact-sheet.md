### Tower Hamlets Specific Vulnerabilities

1. **Young, diverse workforce** - Need reskilling support
2. **High concentration in automatable sectors** - Financial/professional services
3. **Income inequality** - AI could exacerbate existing gaps
4. **Gig economy workers** - Platform jobs at risk from AI agents

## UK AI Policy Context

### Current State (2025)
- **AI Safety Institute** renamed to **AI Security Institute** (Feb 2025)
- Focus shifted from ethics to security concerns
- £100M+ annual funding through 2030
- International collaboration with US, EU, Japan

### Policy Gaps
1. **No comprehensive AI regulation** - Unlike EU AI Act
2. **Limited worker protections** - No retraining guarantees
3. **Unclear liability framework** - Who's responsible for AI errors?
4. **No local government guidance** - Councils unprepared

## Evidence of Impact Already Happening

### Global Examples
- **Software Development**: GitHub Copilot automating 40% of code
- **Customer Service**: ChatGPT replacing help desk workers
- **Legal**: AI doing document review 100x faster than juniors
- **Creative**: Midjourney/DALL-E replacing graphic designers

### Local Examples (London/UK)
- **BT Group**: Planning to cut 55,000 jobs by 2030 (40% due to AI)
- **Law firms**: Magic Circle firms using AI for due diligence
- **Banks**: Automated trading, risk assessment, compliance
- **Government**: HMRC using AI for tax assessment

## The Coordination Problem

### Why Market Forces Won't Solve This
- **Prisoner's Dilemma**: Companies must automate or lose competitiveness
- **Speed of Change**: Faster than worker retraining capacity
- **Capital Concentration**: Benefits flow to AI owners, not workers
- **Verification Trap**: If humans can verify AI work, they could do it themselves

### China's Example
- Spending 3.2% GDP to delay impact by 3-5 years
- UK spends 3.5% GDP on military indefinitely
- Shows coordination IS possible with political will

## What Tower Hamlets Needs

### Immediate Actions
1. **Skills audit** of local workforce
2. **Retraining programs** for at-risk sectors
3. **Support for displaced workers** - Not just UC
4. **Local AI ethics framework** - For council services

### Medium-term (2-3 years)
1. **Alternative economic models** - Worker cooperatives, social enterprises
2. **Universal Basic Services** pilot - Housing, transport, digital
3. **Human-centered sectors** - Care, education, crafts
4. **Progressive taxation** on AI-generated profits

### Long-term (3-5 years)
1. **Post-automation economy planning** 
2. **Democratic participation** in AI governance
3. **International coordination** on standards
4. **Wealth redistribution** mechanisms
