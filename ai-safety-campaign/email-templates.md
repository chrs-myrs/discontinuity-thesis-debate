**Subject: Urgent - AI Employment Crisis Facing Bethnal Green & Stepney Constituents**

Dear Ms Ali,

I am a constituent in Bethnal Green (E2) and a technology professional who has spent the past year researching AI's impact on employment. I am writing with urgent concerns about the unprecedented threat AI poses to our constituency's workers - a crisis that requires immediate parliamentary action.

**Tower Hamlets faces disproportionate risk**: 20% of our local economy depends on financial services, with another 20% in professional and administrative roles. These sectors face automation within 2-5 years, not decades. With unemployment already at 6.3% (up from 4.6% in 2022), we cannot afford to wait.

**This is already happening**: BT Group plans to cut 55,000 jobs by 2030, explicitly citing AI. Magic Circle law firms are automating junior lawyer work. GitHub Copilot now writes 40% of code. Our constituents in Canary Wharf and Tech City see this daily - their colleagues being replaced, not augmented.

**The coordination problem is real but solvable**: My research (which challenged the "Discontinuity Thesis" claiming AI-driven collapse is inevitable) proves that outcomes depend on political choices, not technological determinism. China is spending 3.2% GDP to slow AI displacement - less than we spend on defence. The EU has comprehensive AI regulation. The UK has neither protection nor plan.

I note your participation in Ditchley Foundation discussions on "Techno-Democracy" and AI's impact on society. You understand these issues. But understanding without action means our constituents - particularly our young, diverse workforce - will bear the costs while tech companies reap the benefits.

**What I'm asking you to do**:

1. **Raise this in Parliament**: Table questions about UK AI employment impact assessments and worker protection plans
2. **Push for legislation**: Support comprehensive AI regulation that includes retraining guarantees and transition support
3. **Advocate for Tower Hamlets**: Our borough needs pilot programs for retraining, not just Universal Credit for the displaced
4. **Brief your colleagues**: Many MPs don't grasp the speed and scale of what's coming

I have compiled extensive research on AI's employment impact and practical policy solutions. I would welcome the opportunity to brief you or your staff in detail. This isn't about stopping progress - it's about ensuring our constituents aren't casualties of it.

The window for action is closing. By 2027, it may be too late for meaningful intervention. Our constituents need their representative to act now.

I look forward to your response and to working with you on this critical issue.

Yours sincerely,
Chris Myers

P.S. I'm happy to provide a detailed briefing document with Tower Hamlets-specific data and policy recommendations.

## Email 2: To Mayor Lutfur Rahman

**Subject: Preparing Tower Hamlets for AI-Driven Employment Crisis**

Dear Mayor Rahman,

I am a Tower Hamlets resident and technology professional writing to alert you to an imminent crisis facing our borough's workers due to artificial intelligence automation.

**Tower Hamlets is uniquely vulnerable**: Our employment is concentrated in sectors facing immediate AI disruption - 20% in financial services, 10% in tech, 10% in professional services. These aren't factory jobs being automated; these are the white-collar roles our residents depend on.

**The timeline is 2-5 years, not decades**: Major employers in Canary Wharf are already deploying AI for tasks previously done by humans. Our young, diverse workforce - many first-generation professionals - risk being locked out of careers they trained for.

**Local government must act where national government hasn't**: While Westminster debates, Tower Hamlets can lead. We need:

1. **Immediate skills audit** of our workforce to identify who needs retraining
2. **Partnerships with employers** to understand their AI deployment plans
3. **Retraining programs** targeting our specific sectoral risks
4. **Support systems** beyond Universal Credit for displaced workers
5. **Alternative economic models** - cooperatives, social enterprises - that prioritize employment

The council's response to past challenges shows Tower Hamlets can act independently when our community is threatened. This threat is real, imminent, and will hit our most vulnerable hardest.

I have extensive research on AI employment impact and would welcome the opportunity to present findings to you or relevant cabinet members. We have perhaps 24 months to prepare our residents. After that, we'll only be managing casualties.

Our borough's future depends on acting now.

Regards,
Chris Myers

## Email 3: To London Assembly Member Unmesh Desai

**Subject: East London's AI Employment Emergency - Action Needed**

Dear Mr Desai,

As your constituent in Tower Hamlets, I'm writing about the severe impact AI automation will have on East London employment within the next 2-5 years.

City and East London faces unique exposure through our concentration in financial services, tech, and professional sectors - precisely the areas where AI is already eliminating jobs. This isn't speculation; it's happening now in Canary Wharf and Tech City.

**Regional coordination is essential**: Individual boroughs cannot address this alone. We need London-wide:
- Skills retraining programs at scale
- Pressure on employers for responsible AI deployment  
- Alternative economic development strategies
- Protection for gig economy workers facing AI replacement

The Greater London Authority has the convening power to bring together boroughs, employers, and unions to develop a coordinated response. Without this, East London risks becoming the epicenter of AI-driven inequality.

I can provide detailed analysis and policy recommendations. Time is critical - every month of delay means more unprepared workers facing displacement.

Best regards,
Chris Myers

## Email 4: Follow-Up Template

The pace of AI deployment continues to accelerate while our constituents remain unprepared. [Specific sector] workers in our borough are already seeing their roles automated.

I remain available to provide a detailed briefing on:
- Tower Hamlets-specific employment impacts
- Evidence from other jurisdictions successfully managing AI transition
- Concrete policy proposals suitable for [parliamentary/local] action
- Timeline for intervention before impacts become irreversible

Our constituents need leadership on this issue. Can we schedule a brief meeting to discuss how you can champion their interests?

## Email 5: To Local Councillors

**Subject: Your Ward Faces AI Job Losses - Action Needed**

Dear Councillor [Name],

I'm your constituent in [Ward] writing about artificial intelligence eliminating jobs in Tower Hamlets.

Your ward's residents working in offices, banks, and tech companies face job losses within 2-5 years as AI automates their work. This isn't distant future - it's happening now.

At the council level, you can:
1. Raise this in full council meetings
2. Push for borough-wide skills audit and retraining
3. Ensure council services are prepared for increased demand
4. Advocate for residents with our MP and Mayor

I have detailed research I can share. Our community needs councillors who understand and act on this threat.

Can we discuss how to protect [Ward] residents from AI displacement?

Regards,
Chris Myers
