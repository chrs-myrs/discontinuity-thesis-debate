# Phase 2: Expert Panel Questions for Ben Luong
## Author of the Discontinuity Thesis

*Note: Ben has provided detailed falsification criteria at https://discontinuitythesis.com/proof/ which have been reviewed. These questions probe beyond those stated criteria into implementation details, edge cases, and apparent contradictions with empirical evidence.*

### From Dr. Marcus Chen (Discontinuity Advocate)

1. **Verification Scaling**: Given your falsification criteria require persistent human advantage, how do you address that verification itself is being automated? GPT-4 can now verify GPT-3.5 output with higher accuracy than humans in many domains.

2. **Verification Automation**: Given the 3,330:1 ratio between falling AI costs and rising verification costs (Report 2), what prevents verification itself from being automated first, eliminating the main cost constraint?

3. **Timeline Mechanics**: Your thesis implies rapid cascade, but Report 8 shows 18-36 month industry disruption patterns. What specific mechanism accelerates this beyond historical precedent?

4. **Coordination Impossibility**: How do you reconcile your claim that coordination is impossible with Basel III achieving 143% capital requirement increases under competitive pressure?

5. **Economic Circuit**: If the wage-demand circuit breaks as you predict, what prevents alternative circuits (UBI, gift economy, commons) from emerging as Report 19 documents?

### From Dr. Elena Martinez (Adaptation Economist)

1. **Software Exceptionalism**: Report 10 shows software has unique characteristics (low consequences, minimal regulation, high infrastructure). Why do you believe software's 70% automation probability extends to domains with <5% probability?

2. **Coordination Success**: Basel III achieved global banking coordination under extreme competitive pressure. Why is AI coordination categorically impossible when financial coordination succeeded?

3. **UBI Evidence**: Alaska's Permanent Fund Dividend shows 40 years of UBI with zero employment reduction. Finland and Stockton show increased work participation. How do you maintain UBI creates "zoo animals" against this evidence?

4. **Hidden Costs**: Report 2 shows 73% of enterprises exceed AI budgets by 2.4x with 85% project failure rates. How does Unit Cost Dominance account for these hidden costs representing 70% of total investment?

5. **Market Adaptation Definition**: Your falsification criteria disqualify UBI and redistribution. But if markets create new forms of value exchange (time banks, gift economies, commons management) that maintain human participation, why don't these count as successful adaptation?

### From Dr. Raj Patel (Tech Realist)

1. **Cost Divergence**: How do you account for the 3,330:1 divergence between falling AI inference costs and rising verification engineer salaries? This ratio suggests human oversight becomes MORE expensive as AI gets cheaper.

2. **Hallucination Persistence**: Hallucination rates remain 15-25% in medicine and 8-31% in law despite near-elimination in code generation. What technical pathway eliminates these domain-specific errors?

3. **Automation Ceiling**: Report 7 documents a 70-80% automation ceiling in recursive AI improvement. If AI can't fully automate its own development, how does it achieve 100% automation elsewhere?

4. **Scaling Laws**: GPT-3 to GPT-4.5 shows 1,360x cost increase for 2x performance improvement. How does this support exponential rather than logarithmic improvement?

5. **Verification Paradox**: If AI eliminates most practitioners, who maintains the expertise to verify AI outputs? Doesn't quality degrade without human expertise?

### From Dr. James Thompson (Coordination Theorist)

1. **Basel Success**: Basel Accords achieved 85-95% global compliance on capital requirements despite competitive pressure. What makes AI coordination fundamentally different?

2. **Productivity Surplus**: Chris Myers reports 150:1 productivity gains. Why can't this massive surplus fund verification and quality systems while maintaining competitive advantage?

3. **Professional Resistance**: Medical, legal, and accounting professions have successfully resisted automation through licensing for decades. How does your model account for regulatory capture?

4. **Crisis Coordination**: COVID showed global coordination in 2 weeks, financial crisis in 3 weeks. Why wouldn't AI-driven unemployment trigger similar emergency response?

5. **Mechanism Design**: What specific aspect of AI makes it immune to mechanism design solutions that work in other competitive domains?

### From Dr. Sofia Vasquez (Historical Comparativist)

1. **Historical Precedent**: Telephone achieved 50% penetration in 3 years (1900-1903), smartphones in 2 years. How is AI's timeline uniquely catastrophic?

2. **Job Category Emergence**: AI trainers (+340% demand), prompt engineers (15,000 openings), verification specialists emerging. Why won't new categories continue emerging as historically observed?

3. **Adaptation Speed**: EU AI Act passed in 18 months vs 10+ years for internet regulation. Doesn't this show institutions ARE adapting faster?

4. **Geographic Variation**: Report 16 shows massive global disparities in AI readiness. How does uniform collapse occur with multi-speed adoption?

5. **Practitioner Bias**: Every technology seemed unprecedented to its practitioners. What makes you immune to the "this time is different" fallacy?

### From Chris Myers (CTO/Practitioner)

1. **Implementation Reality**: I see 100x productivity gains but also massive implementation complexity. Your thesis implies smooth automation - how do you account for the messy reality of legacy systems, technical debt, and integration challenges?

2. **Recursive Limits**: I use AI to build AI daily and hit clear ceilings around 70-80% automation. The remaining 20-30% requires human judgment. Doesn't this create permanent human roles?

3. **Business Reality**: Every automation creates new complexity requiring management. I automate one thing and discover three new problems. How does your model account for complexity generation?

4. **Quality Gradients**: In production, we accept 90% accuracy for some tasks but require 99.99% for others. Doesn't this create natural automation boundaries based on consequence severity?

5. **Coordination Observation**: My industry essentially coordinates to not fully automate (maintaining human sales, support, management). Isn't this evidence that implicit coordination already works?

## Meta-Questions from the Panel

### The Verification Problem
If AI replaces cognitive workers en masse, who maintains the deep expertise needed for quality verification? Without practitioners, doesn't the entire system degrade?

### The Demand Question  
Your "zoo animals" metaphor has zero empirical support. Report 3 shows UBI increases entrepreneurship and work participation. Why should we accept your psychological model over data?

### The Physical Bottleneck
You acknowledge physical work sees only 2x gains with 40% of employment. How does this create "mass unemployment" rather than sector rotation? Please show the specific math.

### The Agency Question
Your thesis treats humans as passive economic units. But humans are also voters, protesters, innovators, and revolutionaries. How does your deterministic model account for collective human agency to change the rules when threatened?

## Request for Clarification

1. **Define "Collapse"**: Economic recession? Depression? Civilizational failure? Be specific about severity and timeline.

2. **Quantify Thresholds**: At what unemployment rate does the wage-demand circuit "break"? 20%? 50%? What's the critical point?

3. **Address Geography**: Does this happen simultaneously worldwide or in waves? How do variations affect the thesis?

4. **Specify Mechanisms**: Show the exact causal chain from UCD to each downstream effect, not just correlation.

5. **Implementation Timeline**: Your falsification criteria are clear, but what about timeline? If mass unemployment takes 10 years instead of 2, does that falsify the "discontinuity" aspect even if the end state matches your prediction?

## The Core Challenge

Your thesis exhibits sophisticated analysis of real forces but may conflate software's exceptional characteristics with universal inevitability. The panel needs you to address:

1. Why software's unique automation vulnerability generalizes to all cognitive work
2. How coordination fails despite multiple successful precedents  
3. Why empirical evidence of adaptation (UBI, new jobs, resistance points) doesn't refute determinism
4. What makes this technological disruption categorically different from all previous ones

**The experts await your response.**
