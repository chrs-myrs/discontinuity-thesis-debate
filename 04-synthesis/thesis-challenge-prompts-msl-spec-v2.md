# MSL Specification: Discontinuity Thesis Challenge Prompts v2
## For Systematic Truth Discovery with ChatGPT Implementation

## Purpose
Design a series of prompts that systematically expose logical contradictions within the Discontinuity Thesis ChatGPT, force concessions on specific points, and establish agreed-upon truth through progressive logical constraint.

## Requirements

### General Prompt Requirements
- **MUST** be optimized for ChatGPT interaction patterns
- **MUST** progressively constrain logical escape routes
- **MUST** reference specific claims from the thesis documents
- **MUST** build cumulative logical pressure across exchanges
- **MUST** prevent common deflection tactics (whataboutism, goalpost moving, semantic drift)

### Response Analysis Requirements
- **MUST** include criteria for categorizing responses:
  - Concession (explicit agreement with challenge)
  - Deflection (avoiding the question)
  - Contradiction (conflicting with previous statements)
  - Consistency (maintaining logical coherence)
- **MUST** identify when truth agreement has been achieved
- **MUST** detect when the chatbot is in "loop" patterns

### Progressive Constraint Requirements
- **MUST** start with broad agreement-building prompts
- **MUST** progressively narrow response space
- **MUST** eliminate escape routes identified in previous responses
- **MUST** force binary choices when ambiguity persists
- **MUST** reference chatbot's previous statements to prevent backtracking

### Self-Reference Test Requirements
- **MUST** use the thesis's own logic against itself
- **MUST** quote specific passages from thesis documents
- **MUST** highlight internal contradictions between different claims
- **MUST** force reconciliation of incompatible positions

### Empirical Checkpoint Requirements
- **MUST** reference specific, verifiable predictions
- **MUST** demand concrete evidence for extraordinary claims
- **MUST** test consistency with observable reality
- **MUST** challenge unfalsifiable assertions

### ChatGPT-Specific Requirements
- **MUST** account for ChatGPT's tendency to be agreeable
- **MUST** prevent "both-and" responses when "either-or" is required
- **MUST** detect when ChatGPT is hedging vs genuinely uncertain
- **MUST** use ChatGPT's context window limitations strategically
- **MUST** recognize when ChatGPT is drawing from training vs the specific thesis

### Escape Route Prevention Requirements
- **MUST** anticipate and pre-empt common deflections:
  - "It's more complex than that"
  - "Both can be true"
  - "You're misunderstanding the thesis"
  - "That's not what mechanical means"
  - "The timeline is approximate"
- **MUST** include follow-ups that close semantic loopholes
- **MUST** maintain definitional consistency across exchanges

## Prompt Categories

### Category 1: Definitional Precision
- Force exact definitions of key terms
- Prevent semantic drift during discussion
- Establish measurable criteria for claims

### Category 2: Internal Contradiction
- Identify claims that contradict each other
- Force choice between incompatible positions
- Highlight logical impossibilities

### Category 3: Empirical Testing
- Demand specific, testable predictions
- Compare predictions to current evidence
- Identify unfalsifiable claims

### Category 4: Confidence Calibration
- Extract probability estimates
- Test consistency of confidence levels
- Identify areas of genuine uncertainty

### Category 5: Mechanism Isolation
- Test each mechanism independently
- Identify necessary vs sufficient conditions
- Expose hidden dependencies

### Category 6: Self-Refutation
- Use thesis logic to undermine thesis claims
- Highlight performative contradictions
- Expose recursive problems

## Success Criteria

### Truth Agreement Indicators
- ChatGPT provides specific probability ranges
- ChatGPT acknowledges specific uncertainties
- ChatGPT concedes particular contradictions
- ChatGPT clarifies conditional vs absolute claims
- ChatGPT admits human agency role

### Systematic Discovery Goals
1. Determine if thesis is deterministic or probabilistic
2. Identify which mechanisms are evidenced vs speculative
3. Establish role of human agency in outcomes
4. Clarify actual timeline confidence
5. Uncover hidden assumptions
6. Map areas of genuine uncertainty
7. Distinguish warnings from predictions

## Response Analysis Framework

### Concession Levels
- **Level 1**: Semantic clarification ("By X I meant Y")
- **Level 2**: Scope limitation ("This applies only to...")
- **Level 3**: Probability adjustment ("Less certain than implied")
- **Level 4**: Mechanism modification ("The process works differently")
- **Level 5**: Core claim retraction ("This aspect is incorrect")

### Deflection Patterns
- **Type A**: Complexity increase ("It's more nuanced...")
- **Type B**: Scope expansion ("But also consider...")
- **Type C**: Semantic shift ("Depends on definition...")
- **Type D**: Authority appeal ("The thesis states...")
- **Type E**: Counter-question ("But what about...")

### Loop Detection
- Recognizing when ChatGPT returns to previous positions
- Identifying circular reasoning patterns
- Detecting when no new information emerges
- Knowing when to shift approach

## Prompt Sequencing Requirements

### Opening Sequence
1. Establish shared premises
2. Confirm understanding of thesis
3. Build initial agreement
4. Set cooperative tone

### Development Sequence
1. Introduce first contradiction gently
2. Tighten logical constraints
3. Reference previous admissions
4. Eliminate escape routes
5. Force specific choices

### Closing Sequence
1. Summarize admissions made
2. Highlight remaining contradictions
3. Request final position
4. Document uncertainties acknowledged

## Victory Conditions

### Minimal Success
- ChatGPT acknowledges thesis is not mechanically inevitable
- ChatGPT admits timeline uncertainty
- ChatGPT concedes human agency matters

### Moderate Success
- ChatGPT provides probability ranges for claims
- ChatGPT identifies which mechanisms lack evidence
- ChatGPT acknowledges coordination can work

### Complete Success
- ChatGPT admits core contradictions cannot be resolved
- ChatGPT reframes thesis as warning rather than prediction
- ChatGPT agrees on specific shared truths about AI impact

## Validation Criteria
- Prompts successfully prevent deflection in >70% of exchanges
- ChatGPT makes at least Level 3 concessions
- Internal contradictions are explicitly acknowledged
- Concrete probability estimates are provided
- Areas of uncertainty are clearly mapped
