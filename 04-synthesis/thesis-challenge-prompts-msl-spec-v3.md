# MSL Specification: Streamlined Discontinuity Thesis Challenge Prompts
## Optimized for Minimal Steps, Maximum Impact

## Purpose
Create a minimal set of prompts (3-5) that systematically expose the core contradictions in the Discontinuity Thesis with minimal copy-paste burden while maintaining logical rigor.

## Requirements

### Efficiency Requirements
- **MUST** achieve truth discovery in 3-5 main exchanges
- **MUST** minimize copy-paste burden for user
- **MUST** build on successful patterns from real ChatGPT conversation
- **MUST** force immediate binary choices without escape routes
- **MUST NOT** require long prompt sequences or multiple rounds

### Core Contradiction Requirements
Each prompt **MUST** target one of these proven contradictions:

1. **Falsifiable Inevitability**
   - **MUST** force choice between unfalsifiable (like gravity) or falsifiable (preventable)
   - **MUST** immediately highlight that falsifiable = not mechanically inevitable
   - **MUST** prevent "both-and" responses

2. **China Evidence**
   - **MUST** use thesis's own 3.2% GDP figure
   - **MUST** compare to sustainable spending (US military, EU social)
   - **MUST** prove coordination works using their own evidence

3. **Consumer Paradox**
   - **MUST** demand explanation of who buys products with 90% unemployed
   - **MUST** expose capitalism's dependency on mass consumption
   - **MUST** force acknowledgment of economic model breakdown

### Prompt Structure Requirements

#### Binary Choice Format
- **MUST** present exactly two options (A or B)
- **MUST** make both options problematic for the thesis
- **MUST** explicitly state "Pick A or B" or "Choose one"
- **MUST NOT** allow "it depends" or "both" as valid answers

#### Follow-up Requirements
- **MUST** have pre-planned follow-up for each likely response
- **MUST** use their choice to further constrain logic
- **MUST** reference their previous answer to prevent backtracking
- **MUST** complete trap in one follow-up exchange

#### Evidence Integration
- **MUST** use specific numbers from thesis (3.2% GDP, 90% unemployment, 2027-2029)
- **MUST** compare to real-world benchmarks (military spending, social spending)
- **MUST** make calculations simple and undeniable

### Response Handling Requirements

#### Deflection Prevention
- **MUST** reject "it's more complex" with "Please pick A or B"
- **MUST** reject "both are true" with "They're mutually exclusive, choose one"
- **MUST** reject new definitions with "Using your original definition, pick A or B"
- **MUST** maintain focus on binary choice until answered

#### Convergence Requirements
- **MUST** summarize concessions after 3-5 exchanges
- **MUST** list specific admissions made
- **MUST** ask for agreement on reframing thesis as warning vs prophecy
- **MUST** document which contradictions were acknowledged

### Success Metrics
- **MUST** extract admission that thesis is falsifiable
- **MUST** get acknowledgment that coordination affects outcomes
- **MUST** expose inability to explain post-discontinuity economics
- **MUST** achieve convergence on "warning" vs "mechanical inevitability"

### Minimal Interaction Flow
1. **Opening**: Confirm understanding of thesis claim (1 exchange)
2. **Question 1**: Falsifiable paradox (1 exchange + 1 follow-up)
3. **Question 2**: China evidence (1 exchange + 1 follow-up)  
4. **Question 3**: Consumer paradox (1 exchange + 1 follow-up)
5. **Convergence**: Summarize admissions (1 exchange)

**Total exchanges: 8-10 maximum**

## Non-Requirements
- **NEED NOT** cover every contradiction in the thesis
- **NEED NOT** achieve complete agreement
- **NEED NOT** use complex logical chains
- **NEED NOT** provide educational context
- **NEED NOT** be polite if deflection persists

## Validation Criteria
- User can complete entire challenge in under 10 exchanges
- Copy-paste burden reduced by 70% from v2
- ChatGPT makes substantive concession on at least 2 of 3 core contradictions
- Final position acknowledges thesis is not mechanically inevitable
- Time to complete: Under 15 minutes

## Implementation Notes
- Based on successful real-world test with ChatGPT
- Proven to work with actual Discontinuity Thesis chatbot
- Binary forcing prevents infinite deflection loops
- Using their own evidence prevents denial
- Simple economics makes contradictions undeniable
