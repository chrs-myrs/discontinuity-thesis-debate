# MSL Specification: Discontinuity Thesis Challenge Prompts

## Purpose
Design a series of prompts that systematically expose logical contradictions within the Discontinuity Thesis or force concessions on specific points, with the goal of establishing agreed-upon truth rather than "winning" an argument.

## Requirements

### General Prompt Requirements
- **MUST** be logically rigorous and internally consistent
- **MUST** target specific contradictions identified in the thesis
- **MUST** allow for genuine response without being purely rhetorical
- **MUST** build upon previous responses to create logical chains
- **MUST** be respectful while being intellectually challenging

### Contradiction Types to Target

#### Type 1: Falsification Paradox Prompts
- **MUST** expose the contradiction between "mechanical inevitability" and falsification criteria
- **MUST** force clarification on whether the thesis is deterministic or probabilistic
- **MUST** challenge the logical coherence of unfalsifiable mechanical laws

#### Type 2: Consumer Paradox Prompts
- **MUST** probe who purchases goods/services when 90% lack income
- **MUST** explore the sustainability of an economy without mass consumption
- **MUST** force acknowledgment of capitalism's dependence on consumers

#### Type 3: Verification Contradiction Prompts
- **MUST** highlight the inconsistency in verification being both transitional and permanent
- **MUST** examine the self-undermining nature of the verifier elite argument
- **MUST** probe what happens when verification itself is automated

#### Type 4: Agency Paradox Prompts
- **MUST** expose the contradiction of actively building the "inevitable"
- **MUST** challenge whether human choices matter if outcomes are mechanical
- **MUST** probe the role of decision-makers like Myers in creating vs discovering future

#### Type 5: Value Destruction Loop Prompts
- **MUST** explore how capitalism continues while its foundation erodes
- **MUST** examine where investment capital comes from post-collapse
- **MUST** probe the sustainability of AI development without profit motive

#### Type 6: Timeline Inconsistency Prompts
- **MUST** challenge why exponential improvement has linear timeline
- **MUST** probe why not instant singularity or hard plateau
- **MUST** expose the arbitrariness of 2027-2029 prediction

### Prompt Structure Requirements

#### Opening Prompts
- **MUST** establish shared premises before challenging
- **MUST** use the thesis's own language and frameworks
- **MUST** appear to accept core claims initially

#### Follow-up Prompts
- **MUST** build on specific responses received
- **MUST** tighten logical constraints progressively
- **MUST** prevent escape through vagueness

#### Closing Prompts
- **MUST** force binary choice on key contradictions
- **MUST** summarize the logical chain created
- **MUST** request specific concession or clarification

### Success Criteria

#### Concession Indicators
- Admission that timeline is uncertain rather than mechanical
- Acknowledgment that coordination can affect outcomes
- Recognition that verification creates permanent employment
- Acceptance that human agency plays a role

#### Hypocrisy Indicators
- Claiming both inevitability and falsifiability
- Dismissing coordination while citing coordination examples
- Requiring human consumers while eliminating human income
- Building systems while denying agency

#### Truth Agreement Indicators
- Convergence on specific probability ranges
- Shared acknowledgment of uncertainty areas
- Agreement on role of human choices
- Common understanding of actual mechanisms

## Non-Requirements
- **NEED NOT** be aggressive or confrontational
- **NEED NOT** defend any particular position
- **NEED NOT** achieve complete agreement
- **NEED NOT** resolve all contradictions

## Example Prompt Structures

### Falsification Paradox Example
```
"You state the discontinuity is 'mechanically inevitable' like water freezing at 0Â°C. 
You also provide falsification criteria. 
Can something be both mechanically inevitable and falsifiable? 
If yes, what does 'inevitable' mean? If no, which claim do you retract?"
```

### Consumer Paradox Example
```
"In your model, 90% of humans have no economic value. 
Companies need customers with money to buy products. 
Who buys Midjourney's services when the 90% have no income? 
How does capitalism function without mass consumption?"
```

### Agency Paradox Example
```
"You and Chris Myers are actively choosing to build AI systems.
If the outcome is mechanically inevitable, your choices don't matter.
If your choices do matter, it's not mechanically inevitable.
Which is it: Does human agency affect the outcome or not?"
```

## Validation Criteria
- Prompts force clear binary choices on contradictions
- Response patterns reveal logical inconsistencies
- Each prompt builds on previous responses
- Series leads to either concession or exposed hypocrisy
- Truth agreement emerges on at least some points

## Outcome Goals
1. Establish whether thesis is deterministic or probabilistic
2. Clarify role of human agency in outcomes
3. Identify areas of genuine agreement
4. Expose unfounded certainty claims
5. Find common ground on actual mechanisms
