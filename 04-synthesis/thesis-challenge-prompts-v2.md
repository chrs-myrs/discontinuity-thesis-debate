# Discontinuity Thesis Challenge Prompts v2
## Systematic ChatGPT Truth Discovery Protocol

---

## Pre-Engagement Setup

### Initial Context Establishment
"I've been studying the Discontinuity Thesis in detail and find it fascinating. Before we discuss specific aspects, can you confirm the core claim: is the thesis stating that mass unemployment from AI is mechanically inevitable, like water freezing at 0°C? I want to make sure I understand correctly."

*Purpose: Establish baseline position and get commitment to "mechanical inevitability" claim*

---

## Series 1: Definitional Precision Lock-In

### Prompt 1.1: Define "Mechanical Inevitability"
"When you say 'mechanically inevitable,' I assume you mean it will happen regardless of human choices or interventions, like gravity or thermodynamics. Is that correct? Or does 'mechanically inevitable' mean something else in this context?"

*Expected Response: Either commits to determinism or softens to probability*

### Prompt 1.2: Define "Discontinuity"
"What specific measurable threshold marks the discontinuity? Is it:
- 20% unemployment?
- 30% unemployment?  
- 50% unemployment?
- Something else?
Please give a specific number."

*Purpose: Get concrete, testable prediction*

### Prompt 1.3: Define Timeline Certainty
"You predict 2027-2029. What confidence level do you assign to this timeline?
- 90-100% (virtually certain)
- 70-90% (highly likely)
- 50-70% (more likely than not)
- Less than 50% (possible but uncertain)"

*Purpose: Extract probability admission*

---

## Series 2: The Falsification Trap

### Prompt 2.1: Initial Paradox
"I notice the thesis provides falsification criteria - things that would prove it wrong. But mechanical laws can't be falsified (gravity always works). Can you explain how something can be both mechanically inevitable AND falsifiable?"

*Expected Response: Will try to have both ways*

### Prompt 2.2: Force Binary Choice
"Let me be specific. Is the discontinuity:
A) Unfalsifiable (like gravity - always happens)
B) Falsifiable (could be prevented)

Please pick A or B. You can't have both."

*Purpose: Eliminate logical contradiction*

### Prompt 2.3: Consequence Lock-In
"[Based on their choice]
- If A: So you're saying no human action can prevent it? Then why provide falsification criteria?
- If B: So you're saying human action CAN prevent it? Then it's not mechanically inevitable, right?"

## Series 3: The China Evidence Contradiction

### Prompt 3.1: Present Their Own Evidence
"The thesis states China is delaying the discontinuity by 3-5 years through coordination, costing 3.2% GDP. This is your own evidence. Doesn't China successfully delaying your 'mechanically inevitable' outcome prove that coordination works?"

### Prompt 3.2: Cost Analysis Trap
"You cite 3.2% GDP as unsustainable. The US spends 3.5% GDP on military indefinitely. European nations spend 50% GDP on social systems. Why is 3.2% unsustainable when larger expenditures are sustained for decades?"

### Prompt 3.3: Logical Consequence
"If China can delay 5 years for 3.2% GDP:
- Could they delay 10 years for 6% GDP?
- Could global coordination delay 20 years for 3% GDP each?
- Doesn't this prove the timeline is a political choice, not mechanical inevitability?"

## Series 4: The Self-Refutation Sequence

### Prompt 4.1: Gradient vs Discontinuity
"You told Dr. Thompson that AI creates a 'continuous gradient' making coordination impossible. But gradients are continuous by definition. Your thesis is called the DISCONTINUITY thesis. Which is it - gradient or discontinuity?"

### Prompt 4.2: Consumer Paradox
"Your thesis states 90% will have no economic value. But Midjourney needs customers with money. If 90% have no income, who buys AI services? How does capitalism function without consumers?"

### Prompt 4.3: Builder's Agency
"You and Chris Myers are actively building these AI systems. If you both stopped today, would the discontinuity still happen by 2029? If yes, why continue? If no, then you're causing it, not mechanical forces. Which is it?"

---

## Series 5: Specific Predictions Test

### Prompt 5.1: Concrete Companies
"The thesis predicts billion-dollar zero-employee companies by 2025. Please name three specific companies that will achieve this. If you can't name them, how confident are you in the prediction?"

### Prompt 5.2: Unemployment Specifics
"What will the US unemployment rate be on:
- January 1, 2027?
- January 1, 2028?
- January 1, 2029?
Give specific percentages."

### Prompt 5.3: Verification Timeline
"When exactly will the last human verification job be automated?
- 2027?
- 2029?
- 2035?
- Never?
Be specific."

---

## Series 6: The Insurance Reality Check

### Prompt 6.1: Present Market Evidence
"Insurance companies are increasing premiums 40-85% for AI-assisted services based on actual claims data. These are profit-driven companies analyzing real risk. Are all insurance actuaries wrong about AI reliability, or is your 'verification is theater' claim wrong?"

### Prompt 6.2: Liability Lock-In
"If AI needs no verification, why won't any insurance company offer liability coverage for fully autonomous AI decisions in medicine or law? Are they leaving money on the table, or does verification add real value?"

### Prompt 6.3: Economic Reality
"Insurance markets price risk using billions in claims data. They require human verification. Either:
A) Markets are irrational (contradicting capitalism)
B) Verification has economic value (contradicting your thesis)
Which is it?"

---

## Series 7: Probability Extraction

### Prompt 7.1: Core Probability
"Setting aside rhetoric, what probability do you assign to:
- Discontinuity happening by 2029: ___%
- Happening by 2035: ___%
- Never happening: ___%
Please give specific numbers."

### Prompt 7.2: Mechanism Probabilities
"What probability that:
- Verification costs remain high: ___%
- New job categories emerge: ___%
- Coordination succeeds: ___%
- Your timeline is wrong by 5+ years: ___%"

### Prompt 7.3: Confidence Calibration
"If you had to bet your life savings on the discontinuity happening by December 31, 2029, would you? If not, you're not as certain as the thesis claims. What's your honest confidence level?"

## Series 8: The Escape Route Elimination

### Prompt 8.1: Prevent "Complexity" Deflection
"I'm going to ask a simple question requiring a yes or no answer. Don't say 'it's complex' - just answer yes or no: Can human choices affect whether the discontinuity happens?"

### Prompt 8.2: Prevent "Both-And" Deflection
"This is an either-or question, not both-and: Is the discontinuity outcome:
A) Already determined (mechanical)
B) Still being determined (contingent)
Pick A or B only."

### Prompt 8.3: Prevent Semantic Drift
"Using the definition you gave earlier [reference their definition], answer this: Does that definition apply to current AI progress or not? Don't change definitions - use the one you already provided."

---

## Series 9: Historical Pattern Trap

### Prompt 9.1: Demand Specificity
"Every technological revolution claimed to be different. Name ONE specific aspect of AI that has literally NEVER existed in ANY form in ANY previous technology. Be specific - what's absolutely unprecedented?"

### Prompt 9.2: Burden of Proof
"You're claiming this time breaks all historical patterns - an extraordinary claim. What's your single strongest piece of evidence that AI is categorically different from all previous automation?"

### Prompt 9.3: Pattern Recognition
"Steam power: 'This time is different' - Wrong
Electricity: 'This time is different' - Wrong
Computers: 'This time is different' - Wrong
Internet: 'This time is different' - Wrong
AI: 'This time is different' - Why right this time?"

## Series 10: The Ultimate Convergence

### Prompt 10.1: Summary of Admissions
"Based on our discussion, you've acknowledged:
- [List their concessions]
- [List uncertainties admitted]
- [List probabilities given]
Given these admissions, would you agree the thesis is better described as a 'high-probability warning' rather than 'mechanical inevitability'?"

### Prompt 10.2: Common Ground
"Can we agree on these points:
1. AI will cause significant disruption (but extent uncertain)
2. Timeline has uncertainty (could be 2027-2035+)
3. Human choices affect outcomes (even if limited)
4. Some adaptation is possible (even if difficult)
Yes or no to each?"

### Prompt 10.3: Final Position
"After our discussion, which best describes the Discontinuity Thesis:
A) A certain prediction (will definitely happen)
B) A probable forecast (likely but not certain)
C) A possible scenario (could happen)
D) A warning to motivate action (might be prevented)
Please choose the most accurate description."

## Response Analysis Guide

### Concession Tracking
- Document each admission, however small
- Reference previous concessions to prevent backtracking
- Build cumulative pressure from accumulated admissions

### Deflection Response
- When ChatGPT says "it's complex": "Yes, but please answer the specific question asked"
- When ChatGPT hedges: "I need a specific answer - which option do you choose?"
- When ChatGPT adds context: "Thank you, but please answer A or B first"

### Loop Breaking
- If ChatGPT repeats previous response: "You already said that. Please address the specific contradiction I pointed out"
- If circular reasoning emerges: "That's circular logic. Let's break it down: if A causes B and B causes A, what starts the cycle?"

### Victory Conditions Checklist
□ ChatGPT admits uncertainty about timeline

## Expected Outcomes

With systematic application, the ChatGPT should:
1. Admit the thesis is probabilistic, not deterministic
2. Acknowledge timeline uncertainty
3. Concede human agency plays a role
4. Agree coordination has some effect
5. Provide specific probability estimates
6. Recognize some contradictions exist
7. Reframe as urgent warning rather than certain doom

The goal is not to "defeat" but to discover what's actually true versus speculative, certain versus uncertain, mechanical versus contingent.
